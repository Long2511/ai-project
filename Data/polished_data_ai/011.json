  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint includes persistent back pain, progressive difficulty in walking, and a 'pins and needles' sensation in the legs that have been present for one year.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's history of present illness includes symptoms that began one year ago with back pain. Over the subsequent six months, there was a progressive difficulty in walking. Key symptoms include back pain, difficulty in walking, and a \"pins and needles\" sensation. The severity pattern is chronic and progressively worsening.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient's exposure and epidemiological information is incomplete. They have a travel history of visiting Malawi one year ago, but the vector and animal exposures are unknown. There is also no information on water or food risks, contacts, season outbreak context, or occupation-related risk factors. The patient works as a security guard.",
  "vitals": "The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.5°C or 99.5°F, while all other vital signs are within the normal range.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination findings include tenderness over the lower thoracic spine, severe spasticity of both legs, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes, a thoracic sensory level at T9 (with diminished joint sense in big toes bilaterally), and normal cranial nerves and upper limbs.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's full blood count results are normal, indicating no immediate hematological abnormalities. Diagnostic clues include spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes, and a thoracic sensory level at T9, suggesting potential neurological involvement. Possible treatment regimens for this condition may include antituberculous treatment if the patient has a history of or is suspected to have tuberculosis, and spinal surgery if available and applicable, depending on the specific nature and extent of the patient's condition.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis includes spinal tuberculosis, spinal metastases, transverse myelitis (including autoimmune), and schistosomiasis. The reasons for considering these diagnoses are spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia and upgoing plantar reflexes, a thoracic sensory level at T9, tenderness over the lower thoracic spine, and an unknown travel history to Malawi.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course of the patient involved an initial treatment regimen that included paracetamol and antimalarials, specifically praziquantel and paracetamol. Subsequent treatment consisted of standard first-line antituberculous therapy. The patient showed improvement with a full recovery by day 6. However, complications were not specified in the provided information. The outcome was positive as the patient recovered but faced challenges due to transportation issues, which resulted in them still waiting for a wheelchair.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) confirmed through antituberculous treatment. The evidence includes spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia and upgoing plantar reflexes, a thoracic sensory level at T9, tenderness over the lower thoracic spine, and alternative diagnoses such as spinal metastases, transverse myelitis (including autoimmune), and schistosomiasis have been ruled out.",
  "disease_name_short": "The short form of the disease name is \"Tuberculosis\"."
