{
  "patient_information": "The patient's information includes an age of 32 years, a female sex, and a country of origin in Malawi. There are no reported comorbidities or immunosuppression. The vaccination status is unknown, as well as any allergies the patient may have.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is a headache that has been present for three weeks, accompanied by blurred vision. The symptoms have gradually worsened and do not improve with the use of over-the-counter painkillers.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient has a three-week history of symptoms, including chronic headaches and blurred vision. The severity pattern is gradual in onset, with no accompanying fever or history of convulsions or head trauma.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The provided information under the field \"exposure_and_epidemiology\" includes several uncertainties. It mentions recent travel to Malawi, but the vectors and animals involved are unknown. Similarly, water and food risks remain unspecified. The contacts, seasonal outbreaks, and occupation details are also lacking in this dataset.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs are all within normal limits, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed a wasted and slightly anaemic general appearance. Vital signs were within normal limits, and there was no neck stiffness or visual acuity issues noted in either eye. The abdomen appeared normal as well. However, a neurological deficit was observed with left lateral gaze abduction of the left eye, causing blurring of vision reported by the patient.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's full blood count revealed a normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The malaria rapid test was negative, but the cryptococcal antigen test was positive. During the lumbar puncture, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an increased opening pressure of 50 cmH2O.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic meningitis is the most probable diagnosis, with Cryptococcal meningitis being a likely differential diagnosis. Tuberculous meningitis and bacterial meningitis are considered less likely diagnoses in this context.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course for the patient involved initial treatment with presumptive antimalarial therapy using artemether/lumefantrine, along with antibiotics such as amoxicillin. The patient also underwent repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures. Antifungal treatment was provided with oral fluconazole at a dosage of 1200 mg. Unfortunately, the patient passed away six weeks later due to an unknown cause.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Cryptococcal meningitis, confirmed by a positive cryptococcal antigen test in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This diagnosis is supported by the presence of chronic meningitis and a positive cryptococcal antigen test. However, despite these findings, the CSF examination revealed normal results except for an increased opening pressure.",
