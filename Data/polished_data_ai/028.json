  "patient_information": "The patient's information includes an age of 67 years, a female sex, residence in Cameroon, and occupation as an expatriate.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is palpitations and transient subcutaneous swellings that have persisted for a year.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented to a tropical medicine clinic in Germany with palpitations and reported transient subcutaneous swellings over the past year. There was no history of fever or constitutional symptoms.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The individual's travel history includes living as an expatriate in Cameroon for the past four years, and there have been no reported instances of mosquito exposure.",
  "vitals": "The vital signs recorded are as follows: the heart rate is not available, blood pressure is not available, respiratory rate is not available, and oxygen saturation is not available.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed a general appearance of being afebrile. Upon skin examination, there were no visible subcutaneous swellings. The cardiovascular system showed heart sounds that were clear and regular with no murmurs detected. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. The neurological examination indicated clarity without any abnormalities.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The full blood count results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.20 × 10^9/L, which is within the normal range of 4–10. The hemoglobin level is at 13.8 g/dL, also within the normal range of 12–15. Platelet count stands at 155 × 10^9/L, which falls within the typical range of 150–450. Neutrophils make up 45% of the white blood cells, while eosinophils account for 14%, lymphocytes for 36%, monocytes for 4%, and basophils are at 0%. The echocardiography results show minimal pericardial effusion with no pathological findings.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for the patient includes Filarial infection, characterized by a pattern of transient subcutaneous swellings, eosinophilia, and a history of living in Cameroon for several years; Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), evidenced by eosinophilia, fever, and an urticarial rash, though the patient is afebrile and her migratory swellings do not fit this clinical picture; and Gnathostomiasis or sparganosis, indicated by eosinophilia and migratory swellings. However, these infections are more common in East Asia than in Africa, with reports of sparganosis from Kenya and Tanzania.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course of a patient involved treatment with Albendazole, administered as 200 mg twice daily for 21 days, and Ivermectin, given at an initial dose of 150 μg/kg followed by diethylcarbamazine (DEC) at gradually increasing doses. Clinical improvement was noted through the return to normal absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and a decline in microfilarial count. The outcome showed no observed sequelae and resolved palpitations.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Filarial infection. The evidence includes positive serology for filarial infection and the presence of sheathed microfilaria with a tapered tail characteristic of Loa loa. Confirmation was achieved by detecting microfilariae in the patient's blood after treatment.",
  "disease_name_short": "The disease_name_short is Filarial infection."
