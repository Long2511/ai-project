Key symptoms noted during this period are severe pain and swelling at the site of the bite, hemorrhagic bullae on the right leg, gums starting to bleed, and extensive vomiting. The severity pattern observed is one of progressive worsening over these three weeks.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The study focuses on the epidemiological aspects of snake bites in rural Malawi. The residence travels to rural areas within Malawi and has been bitten by a snake, but the specific vector responsible for the bite remains unknown. The animals involved in the transmission are also not identified. The water and food risks associated with snake bites in this region are currently unexplored. There is no information on potential contacts that might have facilitated the spread of the disease. The season during which outbreaks occur is noted to be the rainy season, but the occupation of those affected remains unspecified.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 39.4°C, with a pulse rate of 126 beats per minute and a blood pressure reading of 85/60 millimeters of mercury. The respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, while the hemoglobin level stands at 9.5 milligrams per deciliter. Additionally, the platelet count is recorded as 60 trillion per liter, and the potassium level in the blood is 4.2 millimoles per liter.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed extensive, foul-smelling necrosis on the right foot and ankle, with tendons exposed. Additionally, inguinal lymph nodes were found to be enlarged. However, there were no reported focal neurologic deficits or signs of respiratory distress.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The laboratory results include a complete blood count (CBC) with the following values: white blood cells (WBC) at 19 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin at 9.5 mg/dL, platelets at 60 × 10^9/L, and potassium (K+) level at 4.2 mmol/L. Other tests mentioned are WBCT20 which is normal, and results in table 26.1 are not provided.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for the patient includes snake bite, which is most likely given the extensive necrosis and septic symptoms observed. Additionally, sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis are considered due to the patient's history of a snake bite and the absence of other potential causes.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course for this patient involved supportive care with oral or intravenous fluids and acetaminophen. No antibiotics were prescribed, but tetanus prophylaxis was administered. Surgical debridement and mesh grafting were performed, followed by physiotherapy. The patient showed clinical improvement with a full recovery by day 6. No complications were documented during the treatment period. The patient was discharged several weeks later, although there was a functional impairment of the right foot that remained.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis for the patient is snake bite, caused by the African puff adder (Bitis arietans). This conclusion was confirmed through positive identification by a healthcare facility. The evidence supporting this diagnosis includes a history of snake bite, extensive necrosis and septic symptoms, and no other causes being considered.",
  "disease_name_short": "The short form for the disease name is \"Snake bite\"."
