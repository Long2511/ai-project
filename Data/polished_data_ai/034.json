  "patient_information": "The patient, a 35-year-old male farmer from Peru with no reported comorbidities or immunosuppression, has recently traveled to the Peruvian highlands.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is a chronic ulcer located on the left arm and multiple nodular lesions also present on the same arm, which have been persisting for two months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient has been experiencing symptoms for two months, including a slowly growing ulcer, painless nodules, and a painful papule that developed into a pustule. The severity of these symptoms has progressively worsened over the past two months. The onset of these symptoms occurred after a scratch on the left hand from a tree branch while working in the fields. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics without improvement, followed by continued antibiotic treatment and traditional medicines applied topically.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The study focuses on a recent travel history to the Peruvian highlands, suggesting potential mosquito exposure due to an endemic setting. No animal exposures were reported, and there were no identified water or food risks. There were no sick contacts reported either. The season of the outbreak context remains unknown, but occupation risk factors include working in the fields.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 4.5 × 10^9/L, which is outside the reference range of 4–10 × 10^9/L. The hemoglobin level is recorded at 11.3 g/dL, and the differential count is normal. Additionally, all other components of the full blood count are within their respective normal ranges.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical exam revealed several notable findings, including a single ulcerative lesion measuring 20 by 30 millimeters with irregular elevated borders. Additionally, there were multiple subcutaneous erythematous nodules each measuring 10 by 10 millimeters. The lymphatic tract was consistent with nodular lymphangitis. However, the rest of the physical examination did not show any abnormalities.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's white blood cell count is 4.5 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin level is 11.3 g/dL, and the differential count is normal. The full blood count remains within normal limits. Microscopy did not observe any Leishmania parasites by direct microscopy, but the leishmanin skin test was negative. Culture results from an ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii. PCR testing was not performed, and serology results are also unavailable. Chest x-ray findings were normal, and PPD skin testing was negative.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "When considering the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with nodular lymphangitis, several conditions should be taken into account. These include cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, and mycobacterial infections caused by M. tuberculosis or M. marinum. The reasons for considering these diagnoses are based on clinical presentation that is compatible with the symptoms of nodular lymphangitis, a history of travel to an area where these diseases are endemic, and the lack of improvement after a full course of pentavalent antimonials, which are commonly used treatments for leishmaniasis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course of the patient involved an initial approach that included the collection of specimens for microscopy and culture, followed by empirical treatment with pentavalent antimonials. The patient was referred for further diagnosis and treatment due to negative results from direct microscopy, leishmanin skin test, and culture of ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration. The diagnosis was confirmed as lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis through positive cultures for S. schenckii and clinical features typical of the disease. Treatment began with itraconazole PO 200 mg/day for an initial duration of 8 months, resulting in the resolution of ulcer and nodular lesions after treatment. The patient was considered cured at this point.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, confirmed through positive cultures for S. schenckii and clinical features typical of the disease. The evidence includes a chronic ulcer with nodular lymphangitis and positive cultures for S. schenckii.",
