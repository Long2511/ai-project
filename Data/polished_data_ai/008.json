  "patient_information": "The patient's information includes an age of 26 years, a sex of female, and a travel history that indicates they recently visited Ghana.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is localized swelling on their left leg that has persisted for about three weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's current condition involves a slow-developing swelling that has been present for three weeks. This swelling is characterized by itchiness rather than pain. The patient does not report any history of fever or arthropod bites, indicating no prior exposure to these conditions.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "During a 6-week trip to Ghana, there were no reported instances of mosquito or tick exposure, according to the travel details provided.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "The patient's physical examination revealed localized swelling with a central scab and slightly hyperaemic skin surrounding it. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy, as no swollen lymph nodes were detected. Additionally, the patient exhibited no fever, but all other aspects of the physical examination were within normal limits.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": null,
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary diagnoses to consider in this case are cutaneous myiasis caused by Tumbu fly, localized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections, and spider bites with eschar-like central necrosis. The reasoning behind these diagnoses is based on several factors: the slow growth of the lesion over a period of weeks without accompanying lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms, and the localized itchy nature of the condition, which collectively point towards myiasis as the most probable differential diagnosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course involved treating the patient by gently removing the scab, followed by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin to block larval respiratory spiracles. Unfortunately, despite these treatments, the lesion was covered with white petroleum jelly and superinfected. The patient returned two days later for a review.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is cutaneous myiasis caused by Tumbu flies, confirmed through the ease of removing larvae using forceps. This conclusion is supported by the observed slow growth of the lesion, absence of lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms, and the localized itchy nature of the condition.",
  "disease_name_short": "The disease name short for cutaneous myiasis is \"Cutaneous Myiasis\"."
