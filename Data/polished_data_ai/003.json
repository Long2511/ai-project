  "patient_information": "The patient is a 26-year-old female with residence in an urban high-density area and occupation as a businesswoman selling vegetables. She has a family history of three healthy children but four toddlers died as toddlers. Her past medical history is unremarkable, and she recently traveled to Malawi. She does not report any allergies.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is a headache that started gradually over time and has been accompanied by confusion lasting for at least one week. Additionally, the patient experienced unilateral ptosis, which was noted by their relatives just one day prior to their visit.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's history of present illness includes an onset that occurred at least one week ago, characterized by an insidious headache and confusion lasting for two days. Unilateral ptosis was noted by the patient's relatives. The progression of symptoms led to clinical deterioration, culminating in a coma after several days of treatment.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The exposure and epidemiology section of the report indicates that there is a recent travel history to Malawi, which implies potential mosquito exposure due to the endemic setting. There have been no animal exposures reported, nor any water or food risks identified. Additionally, there are no sick contacts reported. The season outbreak context remains unknown at this time.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, which is equivalent to 101.1°F; a blood pressure reading of 115/75 mmHg; a heart rate of 86 beats per minute; and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical exam revealed that the patient appeared seriously unwell. The neurological examination showed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14/15, with no neck stiffness, a clear chest, and normal findings for the remainder of the examination. Additionally, there was an issue with the eye exam where the left eye was in a 'down and out' position.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The blood test results show a white blood cell count of 3.2 × 10^9/L, which is within the normal range of 4–10 × 10^9/L; hemoglobin level at 10.2 g/dL, falling short of the typical range of 12–14 g/dL; platelet count at 155 × 10^9/L, within the acceptable range of 150–350 × 10^9/L; serum glucose level at 4.0 mmol/L, which is below the normal threshold of 3.9–11.1 mmol/L; and a negative result for malaria thick film and cryptococcal antigen test. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals an opening pressure of 32 cmH₂O, significantly elevated from the normal range of 12–20 cmH₂O; white cell count at 54 cells/μL, exceeding the usual limit of 0–5 cells/μL; protein concentration at 3.0 g/L, higher than the standard of 0.25–0.55 g/L; and glucose concentration at 1.3 mmol/L, which is below the acceptable level of <2.2 mmol/L.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "When considering the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with symptoms such as fever, headache, confusion, and cranial nerve palsy, it is important to include infectious meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, and cryptococcal meningitis. These conditions are considered due to their clinical presentation and specific CSF findings of high protein and low glucose levels. Additionally, recent travel to Malawi may also be a reason for considering these diagnoses.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course of this patient involved starting treatment with ceftriaxone 2g bid and fluconazole 1200mg od, following the local protocol for cryptococcal meningitis when amphotericin B and flucytosine were not available. Unfortunately, the patient's condition deteriorated, slipping into a coma after a few days of treatment. This was complicated by bilateral basal ganglia infarctions as evidenced by an MRI scan. Despite these efforts, the patient passed away in the hospital.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is tuberculous meningitis. This was confirmed through a positive CSF culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a positive HIV serology test. The evidence supporting this diagnosis includes clinical symptoms such as fever, headache, confusion, and cranial nerve palsy, along with CSF findings of high protein and low glucose levels. Additionally, the patient had recently traveled to Malawi.",
  "disease_name_short": "The disease name short for Tuberculous Meningitis is \"Tuberculous Meningitis\"."
