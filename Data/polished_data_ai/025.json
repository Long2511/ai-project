  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's history of present illness begins 10 years prior to their admission, when they sustained a leech bite on the dorsum of their left foot. This injury led to the development of a small, painless red nodule that over time evolved into a verrucous lesion. The lesion gradually grew in size and spread up to the patient's knee. In the three days preceding their admission, there was a notable change as the ankle became painful and swollen.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient's recent travel history includes a trip to Laos, but there have been no reported instances of vector exposure or contact with sick individuals in this context.",

  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed gross swelling, hyperemia, and heat in the skin of the left lower leg and foot, characterized by several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions. The foot was painful and swollen with an unpleasant odor, while the ankle also exhibited pain and swelling.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's complete blood count (CBC) results were not reported.

Additionally, a PCR test from the skin tissue was positive for Fonseca pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for chronic verrucous skin lesions includes Sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii and chromoblastomycosis. Mycetoma, commonly known as 'Madura Foot', is characterized by fistulating lesions discharging granules and can be either eumycetoma or actinomycetoma. Malignant conditions that may also present with similar symptoms include squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis.",

The outcome was successful healing of the lesions without any complications, although some residual swelling and hypopigmentation were observed.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Chromoblastomycosis, confirmed through a positive PCR test for Fonseca pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica. This disease is characterized by the presence of brownish, round, thick-walled sclerotic cells in skin scrapings.",
