  "patient_information": "The patient information includes an age of 34 years, a female sex, a positive HIV status, and a country of origin in Malawi. The clinical course is described as slowly progressive with half-sided weakness.",
  "chief_complaint": null,
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's history of present illness indicates that symptoms began 3 months ago. These include a limp in the left leg, progressive weakness affecting both the left arm and leg, and reduced sensation of pain in the left leg and arm. The duration and severity pattern of these symptoms are not specified.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The provided content under the field \"exposure_and_epidemiology\" includes a recent travel history to Malawi.

  "vitals": "The vital signs recorded are as follows: the temperature is not available, blood pressure is not available, heart rate is not available, respiratory rate is not available, and oxygen saturation is not available.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed a spastic hemiparesis on the left side, with hyperreflexia. The power in the left leg was rated as 2/5 (active movement with gravity eliminated), while the power in the left arm was rated as 3/5 (active movement against gravity). Sensory impairment was noted in the left leg, specifically reduced sensation of pain. Cranial nerves were found to be normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The full blood count results show a WBC count of 3.8 × 10^9/L, which is below the reference range of 4–10; Hemoglobin level at 9.9 g/dL, also below the normal range of 12–14; and Platelets at 140 × 10^9/L, within the acceptable range of 150–350. The serology and microbiology tests were not performed. MRI imaging revealed multi-focal T2 hyperintense lesions predominantly affecting the white matter with a more significant presence in the right hemisphere, as well as a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle.",
  "differential_diagnosis": null,
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course for this patient involved antiretroviral therapy (ART), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, and empirical antitoxoplasmosis treatment with high-dose co-trimoxazole. At a 4-week follow-up, the clinical status remained unchanged. However, at 8 weeks, there was further deterioration of power in the left hand. An MRI revealed multi-focal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter and more prominent in the right hemisphere, as well as a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis does not include a specific disease name short form, causative agent, or confirmation method.",
