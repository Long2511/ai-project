  "patient_information": "The patient's information includes an age of 14 years, a sex of male, no reported comorbidities or immunosuppression, and an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, there is no allergy history recorded for this individual.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is difficulty in walking, which has an acute onset and has been present for less than one week.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's timeline indicates that the illness began about two years ago with an acute onset and has not progressed over the subsequent two years. The key symptoms include feelings of heaviness in the legs and trembling, which have led to difficulty walking. Notably, there is no history of fever, pain, sensory issues, bladder or bowel problems, or any signs of disease progression. The severity pattern is described as non-progressive.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The individual, residing in a village in northern Tanzania with limited agricultural suitability where cassava is the main staple food crop, has no history of back pain, sensory impairment, or bladder dysfunction. Their diet for 2 months before illness was almost exclusively cassava. The outbreak context involves several other people being affected in his own and neighboring villages at around the same time, starting about 2 years earlier with an acute onset. Occupation-wise, they work as a shoe repairer.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs are all within normal limits, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination revealed that the patient is well nourished with normal vital signs. Cranial nerves were found to be normal but bilateral optic pallor was noted on fundoscopy. The limbs showed symmetrical spastic paraparesis, with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees, hyperreflexia, sustained ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. The arms were normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood glucose, creatinine, urine analysis, microscopy of stool and urea for Schistosoma species, HIV serology, VDRL test, lumbar puncture, and radiographs of chest and spine were all normal or negative.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for spinal cord issues includes spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease), transverse myelitis, and spinal cord infections such as schistosomiasis and tuberculous meningitis. It also considers spinal malignancy, mainly metastases. Exclusion criteria include no history of back pain, no sensory impairment, and no bladder dysfunction; symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or genitourinary involvement; an acute onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive course; and occurrence in a cassava-growing area, usually accompanied by other cases emerging at the same time.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course of supportive care focuses on providing support, symptomatic improvement, and disease prevention. Symptomatic improvement involves assisting patients to walk using a stick or crutches, with some benefiting from the use of a wheelchair. Disease prevention is crucial as there is no cure for konzo, which results in permanent spastic paraparesis.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is clinical syndrome of spastic paraparesis. Likely cause is chronic high dietary exposure to cyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava tubers. However, the exact pathogenic mechanism of konzo remains unknown. Confirmation method involves symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or genitourinary involvement. Evidence includes an acute onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive course and occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other cases emerging at the same time.",
  "disease_name_short": "The disease name short is Konzo."
