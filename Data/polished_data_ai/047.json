  "patient_information": "The patient's information includes an age of 32 years, a sex of male, comorbidities such as being HIV positive with advanced HIV immunosuppression and TB co-infection, indicating that the patient is immunosuppressed. The vaccination status is unknown, and there is no allergy information available.",
  "chief_complaint": "The patient's chief complaint is a painfully swollen neck that has persisted for approximately six weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient has experienced a six-week history of productive cough and chest pain, accompanied by weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and a painful swelling in the neck. Key symptoms include a productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and a painful swelling in the neck. There are no pertinent negatives reported. The severity pattern has been progressive worsening over six weeks.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The individual in question is a 32-year-old Malawian male who recently traveled to Malawi. There were no reported animal or water/food exposures, nor any sick contacts. The season and occupation of the outbreak are unknown.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 39.2°C, which is equivalent to 102.56°F, a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and normal blood pressure.",
  "physical_exam": "During the physical exam, large and matted lymph glands were palpable in the neck area. The rest of the examination did not reveal any notable findings.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient's initial full blood count revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.3 × 10^9/L, which is outside the reference range of 4–10 × 10^9/L; hemoglobin at 6.3 g/dL, below the normal range of 13–15 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at 66 fL, within the typical range of 80–98 fL; and platelet count at 246 × 10^9/L, also outside the reference range of 150–350 × 10^9/L. Microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) showed a positive result with a score of 2+. The repeat full blood count indicated a WBC count of 7.8 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin at 6.7 g/dL, MCV at 84 fL, and platelet count at 428 × 10^9/L. The CD4 count was found to be 109 cells/μL, while the HIV-1 RNA level was below 400 copies/mL.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "When considering differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with lymphadenitis, several possibilities should be taken into account. These include tuberculous lymphadenitis, bacterial lymphadenitis that may have been iatrogenic, and lymphoma. The initial diagnostic approach involves microscopic examination of the lymph gland sample to look for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), which can indicate tuberculosis. Additionally, an initial treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids might be prescribed based on clinical suspicion. Further evaluation includes a full blood count, where marked microcytosis is noted initially but resolves upon repeat testing, suggesting that the condition may not be related to iron deficiency or other hematological disorders. These findings help narrow down the differential diagnosis and guide further management decisions.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The management and clinical course for this patient involved initial treatments with antituberculous therapy (comprising streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), corticosteroids, and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. Despite these interventions, there was no improvement after three weeks of treatment as evidenced by persistent clinical manifestations such as fever, night sweats, lack of appetite, and fluctuant glands in the neck. No complications were reported during this period. The patient's outcome was favorable following incision and drainage, antibiotic treatment, a short course of corticosteroids while continuing tuberculosis (TB) treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART).",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Tuberculous lymphadenitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Confirmation methods include microscopy for AFB in a lymph gland sample and a CD4 count less than 100 cells per microliter. The evidence supporting this diagnosis includes initial treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids, improvement after incision and drainage, antibiotic treatment, and corticosteroids, as well as ruling out other causes of clinical deterioration.",
  "disease_name_short": "The disease name short for Tuberculous lymphadenitis is \"Tuberculosis\"."
