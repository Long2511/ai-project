The child was treated successfully with antibiotics and nutritional support. His face healed with contractures, resulting in disfigurement and salivary incontinence. At age 9 years, he was referred for surgery by a visiting international surgical team. After two surgeries, his appearance was improved, and the salivary incontinence corrected.

Noma is an opportunistic infection, primarily affecting children aged 1 to 7 years, whose immunity is compromised by malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Risk factors include extreme poverty, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, viral infections (especially measles and HIV), poor sanitation and living in close proximity to livestock. The true aetiology of noma is unknown. The pathogenesis appears to be a complex combination of factors, including poverty, poor oral hygiene facilitating necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, malnutrition and infectious diseases such as malaria and measles leading to impaired immunity.
