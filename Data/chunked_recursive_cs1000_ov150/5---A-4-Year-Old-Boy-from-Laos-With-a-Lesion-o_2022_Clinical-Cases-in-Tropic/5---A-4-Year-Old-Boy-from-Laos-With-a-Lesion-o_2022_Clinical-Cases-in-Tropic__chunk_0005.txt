Noma is a neglected and forgotten disease, because it primarily affects the poorest children living in remote areas of developing countries. Health workers throughout the world often do not recognize this disease, so it remains underreported and unknown. Case fatality rate if untreated is 70% to 90%. Treatment with antibiotics and nutritional support can prevent disease progression and save the child's life. Survivors suffer with disfigurement, functional impairment and psychosocial isolation.

Noma is an indicator of extreme poverty and inadequate public health systems. The elimination of extreme poverty, provision of prenatal care, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, immunizations, food security and improved nutrition for the poorest children can lead to the eradication of this preventable childhood disease.
