This chronically malnourished child, living in a remote village of a poor developing country, has a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face.

A few days earlier, when the child had a sore on the face and bad breath, you may have suspected a tooth abscess and cellulitis. The rapid destruction of tissue is typical of noma, an opportunistic infection that affects poor children whose immune systems are compromised by malnutrition and often other infections, commonly measles or malaria. Other ulcerating facial lesions such as oral cancer, syphilis and yaws are unlikely in a young child. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is unlikely to develop at such a rapid pace and be so destructive. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis may lead to severe tissue destruction but it is non-endemic in Laos. There are no diagnostic laboratory tests because the diagnosis is made clinically.
