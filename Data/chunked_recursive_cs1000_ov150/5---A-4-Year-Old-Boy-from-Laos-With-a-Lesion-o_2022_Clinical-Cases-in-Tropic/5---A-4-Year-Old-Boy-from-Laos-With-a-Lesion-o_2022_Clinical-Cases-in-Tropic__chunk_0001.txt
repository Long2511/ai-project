You are sent a picture of a 4-year-old boy taken by a visitor at a remote district hospital in Laos. You receive a limited history and physical examination: Three days ago, the family noticed a dark sore on the child's cheek. The child's breath smells bad, he is not eating and he appears listless. The lesion progressed quickly from a sore to eat through the child's cheek. The child, who is unimmunized, had a fever and rash about 2 months ago and recovered. The family is very poor. The local doctors do not recognize this disease.

The 4-year-old child appears small and quiet. He is stunted and thin. His mouth has a gangrenous lesion that has destroyed part of his upper and lower lips and cheek, exposing his teeth.

This chronically malnourished child, living in a remote village of a poor developing country, has a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face.
