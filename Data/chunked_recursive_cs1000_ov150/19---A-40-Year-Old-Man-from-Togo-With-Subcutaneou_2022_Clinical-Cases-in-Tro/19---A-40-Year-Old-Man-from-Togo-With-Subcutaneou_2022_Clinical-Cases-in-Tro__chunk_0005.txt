The lifespan of the adult worms is about 12 years. After 10 years, usually no further treatment with ivermectin is required after therapy with a combination of ivermectin and doxycycline, if ivermectin was administered 2 to 3 times every year and if serological tests have turned negative. However, in onchocerciasis-endemic areas new infections are possible. To calculate the probability of a reinfection through an individual black fly with O. volvulus, worm-specific DNA (Ov150) is tested by poolscreen in vector samples (black flies) using polymerase chain reaction.
