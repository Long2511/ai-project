The clinical triad of ocular changes, itchy dermatitis with atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous nodules in a patient from rural Togo makes onchocerciasis (river blindness) the most likely differential diagnosis. A fast-flowing river is the preferred breeding site for Simulium blackflies, which transmit the disease.
The picture of his left eye shows keratitis semilunaris, a form of band-shaped sclerosing keratopathy commonly seen in onchocerciasis. The central and upper parts of the cornea are initially clear, but may become affected as the disease progresses.
Subcutaneous nodules can resemble lipomas and cysticerci of Taenia solium.
Pruritic dermatitis may also be caused by scabies or be seen in papular pruritic eruptions associated with HIV infection. In patients from West Africa, infection with Mansonella streptocerca can also cause pruritus. Chronic dermatitis can also be seen in yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections and eczema.
