Ivermectin is now the drug of choice for individual and mass treatment of onchocerciasis. Ivermectin kills microfilariae but has little effect on adult worms apart from reducing embryogenesis. It has to be given repeatedly throughout the lifespan of the adult worm (10-14 years). For individual treatment, ivermectin is provided as a single dose of 150 µg/kg PO. Treatment should be repeated in 3- to 6-month intervals. In mass treatment programmes it is usually provided annually. Ivermectin should not be given to patients with heavy Loa loa infections and microfilarial counts greater than 30,000/mL, because this may result in fatal encephalitis. Ivermectin can also cause significant adverse events in patients with lower microfilarial counts. For regions co-endemic of onchocerciasis and L. loa, a mobile phone-based, point-of-care microscopy tool - the LoaScope - has proven helpful to easily identify patients with high parasitaemia of L
