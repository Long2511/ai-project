A 40-year-old man from Togo presents to a local clinic. He has noticed changes in both of his eyes over the past 4 years. There are no visual disturbances, but he is worried: In his village there are adults in each family who have turned completely blind after their eyes had shown features very similar to the changes he has noticed in his own eyes.
He has also observed some painless bumps under his skin which have developed over the past two decades. The patient also complains of suffering from intense itching of his skin that keeps him awake at night.
The patient has always lived in a village in the savannah near a fast-flowing river. He reports that small biting flies are common near the river.
