Onchocerciasis ('river blindness') is caused by O. volvulus, a filarial nematode. It is transmitted by biting Simulium species blackflies, which breed in rapidly flowing freshwater. Adult females of O. volvulus lodge in human subcutaneous tissue and shed live microfilariae. Microfilariae migrate through the skin and often into the eyes. Most pathology is caused by immune reactions to dead and dying microfilariae and perhaps to their endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. Typical clinical features of onchocerciasis are:
1. Non-tender subcutaneous nodules located mainly over bony prominences
2. Dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin ('leopard skin'), lichenification and thickening of the skin ('lizard skin'), and skin atrophy at times leading to 'hanging groins'. The skin changes may be stigmatizing and the unrelenting itch may cause sleep disturbances, depression and even lead to suicide
