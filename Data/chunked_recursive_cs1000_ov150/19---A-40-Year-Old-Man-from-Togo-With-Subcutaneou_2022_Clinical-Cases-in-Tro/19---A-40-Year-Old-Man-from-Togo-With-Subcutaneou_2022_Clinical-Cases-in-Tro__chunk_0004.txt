The patient's presentation appears very typical for onchocerciasis. In an endemic, resource-limited setting his diagnosis would most probably be made on clinical grounds alone. Skin snips taken from the vicinity of a subcutaneous nodule may show microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus.
Slit-lamp examination of the eyes may reveal microfilariae in the anterior chamber of the eye and in the cornea. Nodulectomy of subcutaneous nodules may show adults of O. volvulus, but this is not routinely done.
Serological tests were less useful in patients from endemic areas in the past, because antibody test results lacked specificity and were not clearly linked to clinical disease.
However, serological tests which detect IgG4 responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and the recombinant Ov16 antigen are recommended by WHO. In case of a positive result it is recommended to continue ivermectin therapy.
