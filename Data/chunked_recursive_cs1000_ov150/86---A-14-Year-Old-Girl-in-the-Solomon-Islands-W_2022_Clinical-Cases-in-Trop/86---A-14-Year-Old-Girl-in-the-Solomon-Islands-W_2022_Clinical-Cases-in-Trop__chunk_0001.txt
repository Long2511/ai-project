A 14-year-old girl was seen in the Solomon Islands. She reported a painless, non-healing large ulcer of her left leg that began 1 month earlier.

On examination there was a large lesion (approximately 3 cm diameter) on the left lower leg covered by a layer of crust. Lower down the leg a smaller, similar lesion was noted. There was no regional lymphadenopathy or evidence of any other skin or bone lesions.

A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at a titre of 1:64, where the normal result is negative.
