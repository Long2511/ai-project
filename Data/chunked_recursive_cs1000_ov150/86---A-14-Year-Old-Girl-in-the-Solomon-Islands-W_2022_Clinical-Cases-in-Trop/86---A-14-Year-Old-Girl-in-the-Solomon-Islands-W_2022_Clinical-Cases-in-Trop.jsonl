She reported a painless, non-healing large ulcer of her left leg that began 1 month earlier.\n\nOn examination there was a large lesion (approximately 3 cm diameter) on the left lower leg covered by a layer of crust. Lower down the leg a smaller, similar lesion was noted. There was no regional lymphadenopathy or evidence of any other skin or bone lesions.\n\nA rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at a titre of 1:64, where the normal result is negative.\n\nA 14-year-old girl from the Solomon Islands presenting with a chronic leg ulcer."}

The satellite lesion on the leg is also very typical of early yaws lesions. The patient has a high-titre positive RPR test which is consistent with the diagnosis. A number of other bacteria, in particular Haemophilus ducreyi, can cause skin lesions that clinically appear similar to those of early yaws. Other relevant differential diagnoses are pyoderma, tropical ulcer, cutaneous diphtheria, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection.\n\nA single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg single dose; maximum dose 2 g) or a single intramuscular (IM) dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin (<10 years of age: 0.6 million units single dose; ≥10 years of age: 1.2 million units single dose) is the treatment of choice. A four-fold fall in titre at 6 months indicates cure."}

The patient was seen again at the hospital 12 months later with a similar ulcer on the right leg.\n\nThe RPR test was repeated and was positive at a titre of 1:8. Given a greater than four-fold fall in the RPR titre this was considered cure after the recent treatment. The other leg ulcer was therefore interpreted to be of a different aetiology."}

In the Pacific region, yaws remains highly endemic in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, as well as in Indonesia and Timor-Leste. There is also evidence for a re-emergence of yaws in the Philippines were the disease was considered eradicated since the 1970s. The disease is also still endemic in parts of West and Central Africa. Yaws is normally seen in young children; it is associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The disease consists of primary, secondary and tertiary phases. The primary lesion usually starts as a localized papule 2 to 10 weeks after inoculation. Common sites are the lower legs and the face. The papule may develop into a large nodule 2 to 5 cm in diameter that ulcerates. Secondary lesions appear from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary lesion and may include a variety of skin lesions"}

Secondary lesions appear from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary lesion and may include a variety of skin lesions. Arthralgias and malaise are the most common additional symptoms and may be accompanied by early osteoperiostitis of the proximal phalanges of the fingers (dactylitis) or long bones (forearm, tibia, or fibula). Late-stage disease is characterized by destructive lesions of soft tissues and bones. Diagnosis is predominantly based on serology and relies on both treponemal tests (such as the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay, TPPA) and non-treponemal tests (such as RPR test). Benzathine benzylpenicillin and azithromycin are the treatments of choice, with the latter the preferred drug to use in mass treatment campaigns. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months (for example from 1:64 to 1:16) is considered to indicate cure.
