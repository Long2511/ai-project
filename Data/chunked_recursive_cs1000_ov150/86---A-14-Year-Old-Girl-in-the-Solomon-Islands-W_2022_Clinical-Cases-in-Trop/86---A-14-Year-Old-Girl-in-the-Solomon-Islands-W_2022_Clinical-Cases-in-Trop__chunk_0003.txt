She was treated with a single IM dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin and the skin lesion resolved over the next 10 days. The patient was seen again at the hospital 12 months later with a similar ulcer on the right leg.

The RPR test was repeated and was positive at a titre of 1:8. Given a greater than four-fold fall in the RPR titre this was considered cure after the recent treatment. The other leg ulcer was therefore interpreted to be of a different aetiology.
