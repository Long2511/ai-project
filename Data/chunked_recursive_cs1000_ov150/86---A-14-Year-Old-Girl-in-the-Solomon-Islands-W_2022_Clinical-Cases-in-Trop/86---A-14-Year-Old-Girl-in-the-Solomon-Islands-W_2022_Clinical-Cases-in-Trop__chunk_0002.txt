A 14-year-old girl from the Solomon Islands presenting with a chronic leg ulcer.

The patient has a clinical lesion suspicious for yaws, which is still a common problem in the West Pacific. The satellite lesion on the leg is also very typical of early yaws lesions. The patient has a high-titre positive RPR test which is consistent with the diagnosis. A number of other bacteria, in particular Haemophilus ducreyi, can cause skin lesions that clinically appear similar to those of early yaws. Other relevant differential diagnoses are pyoderma, tropical ulcer, cutaneous diphtheria, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection.

A single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg single dose; maximum dose 2 g) or a single intramuscular (IM) dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin (<10 years of age: 0.6 million units single dose; ≥10 years of age: 1.2 million units single dose) is the treatment of choice. A four-fold fall in titre at 6 months indicates cure.
