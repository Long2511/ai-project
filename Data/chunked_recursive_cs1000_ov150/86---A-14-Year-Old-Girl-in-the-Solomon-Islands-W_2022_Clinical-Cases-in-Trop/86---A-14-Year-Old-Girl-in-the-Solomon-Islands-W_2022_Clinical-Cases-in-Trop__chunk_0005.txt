. Secondary lesions appear from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary lesion and may include a variety of skin lesions. Arthralgias and malaise are the most common additional symptoms and may be accompanied by early osteoperiostitis of the proximal phalanges of the fingers (dactylitis) or long bones (forearm, tibia, or fibula). Late-stage disease is characterized by destructive lesions of soft tissues and bones. Diagnosis is predominantly based on serology and relies on both treponemal tests (such as the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay, TPPA) and non-treponemal tests (such as RPR test). Benzathine benzylpenicillin and azithromycin are the treatments of choice, with the latter the preferred drug to use in mass treatment campaigns. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months (for example from 1:64 to 1:16) is considered to indicate cure. Similar lesions to those of early yaws may be caused by other bacteria, in particular H
