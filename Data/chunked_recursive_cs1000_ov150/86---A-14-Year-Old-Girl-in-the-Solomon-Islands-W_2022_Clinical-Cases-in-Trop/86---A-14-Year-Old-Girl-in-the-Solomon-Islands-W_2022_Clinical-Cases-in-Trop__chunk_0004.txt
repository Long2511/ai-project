Yaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, which is spread by skin-to-skin contact in warm, humid environments. In the Pacific region, yaws remains highly endemic in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, as well as in Indonesia and Timor-Leste. There is also evidence for a re-emergence of yaws in the Philippines were the disease was considered eradicated since the 1970s. The disease is also still endemic in parts of West and Central Africa. Yaws is normally seen in young children; it is associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The disease consists of primary, secondary and tertiary phases. The primary lesion usually starts as a localized papule 2 to 10 weeks after inoculation. Common sites are the lower legs and the face. The papule may develop into a large nodule 2 to 5 cm in diameter that ulcerates. Secondary lesions appear from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary lesion and may include a variety of skin lesions
