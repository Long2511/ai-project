The patient's white blood cell count was 12.3 x 10⁹/L, which is above the reference range of 4-10. Her eosinophil count was significantly elevated at 2.34 x 10⁹/L, compared to a reference value of less than 0.5. The haemoglobin level was 11.7 mg/dL, slightly below the 12-14 reference range, and the mean corpuscular volume was low at 70 fL against a reference of 83-103. Platelets were normal at 330 x 10⁹/L, within the reference range of 150-350. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 20 mm/h, where the reference is less than 10. The IgE level was markedly high at 944 U/mL, far exceeding the reference of less than 100. Creatinine was normal at 62 µmol/L, below the reference of 80. ALT was 28 U/L and GGT was 35 U/L, both within their normal ranges of less than 30 and less than 40 respectively. The C-reactive protein level was less than 5 mg/L, which is normal.
