A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid showed 1877 leukocytes/µL (reference value <5), with 42% eosinophils, 39% lymphocytes, 18% monocytes and 1% neutrophils. CSF protein levels were elevated at 1.59 g/L (reference value <0.45), glucose was 1.85 mmol/L (reference range: 2.2-3.9).
On microscopic examination of the CSF, no larvae could be detected. Ziehl-Neelsen stain as well as cryptococcal antigen were negative. There were no suspected malignant cells. CSF culture did not yield any bacterial or fungal growth. Urine and stool microscopy did not show any ova of Schistosoma species. Taenia solium serology was negative, as were Fasciola hepatica and Paragonimus serologies. Toxo-cara canis serology was weakly positive but did not show any change of titre on follow-up. HIV serology was negative.
