One main cause of parasitic eosinophilic meningitis is Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which has an incubation period of 2 to 35 days. Infection is sourced from the consumption of infected crustaceans, snails, prawns, crabs, frogs, or contaminated vegetables, and it is found geographically in South-east Asia, the Pacific basin, Australia, and the Caribbean. Its clinical features include paraesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face, and serology involves a Western blot of antibodies against the 31 kD antigen. Another cause is Gnathostoma spinigerum, with an incubation period ranging from days to months. The source of infection is the consumption of infected poultry or fish, snakes, or frogs. It is found in South-east Asia, particularly Thailand, and is emerging in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical features include migrating subcutaneous swellings, creeping eruption, and sharp radicular pain at the onset. Serology for this pathogen uses a Western blot of antibodies against the 24 kD antigen
