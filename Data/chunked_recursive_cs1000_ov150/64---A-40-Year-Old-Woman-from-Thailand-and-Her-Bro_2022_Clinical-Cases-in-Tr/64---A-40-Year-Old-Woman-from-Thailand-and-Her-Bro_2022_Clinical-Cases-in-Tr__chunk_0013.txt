To date, no standard of care treatment regimen for CNS angiostrongyliasis exists. Mild cases may be managed symp-tomatically with serial lumbar punctures and analgesics. More severe cases may be treated with corticosteroids alone or in combination with anthelmintic drugs. Corticosteroids (eg prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) reduce the duration and intensity of headache. The use of antiparasitic drugs (eg albendazole) is controversial and the benefit of antipararasitic treatment compared to steroid use alone is marginal. If anti-parasitic drugs are administered, they should be given with steroid cover.
