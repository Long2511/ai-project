The initial CSF opening pressure was elevated, at 34 cmH2O (reference range 12-20). Lumbar puncture relieved the patient's headache and was therefore repeated twice, whereupon the patient felt markedly better. No further specific treatment was prescribed. She received iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia. The patient was discharged significantly improved after a 1-week hospital stay. After her discharge, serology results came back and Western Blot showed specific antibodies against 31kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen. Since the patient hat no symptoms any more no further treatment was prescribed. At 4-week follow-up she had fully recovered and her peripheral eosino-phil count had returned to normal.
