Eosinophilic meningitis is defined as the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microlitre of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count. Invasion of the central nervous system by the food-borne nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis, and less frequently, Gnathos-toma spinigerum, are the most common causes.
