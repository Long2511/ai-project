Rarely, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, paragoni-miasis, fascioliasis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis and trichinel-losis can be associated with eosinophilic meningitis; however, the meningeal involvement is usually not prominent.
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the rat lungworm, is the most common infectious cause of eosinophilic meningitis. Humans are infected by ingestion of Angiostrongylus larvae in interme-diate hosts such as fresh water snails and slugs; or transport (paratenic) hosts, such as prawns, crabs and frogs; or salad and vegetables contaminated with slime of infected snails. Once ingested, the third stage larvae (L3) penetrate the intes-tinal wall, reach the portal vein and from there enter the systemic circulation. A. cantonensis is a truly neurotropic hel-minth. Humans are dead-end hosts, the larvae die in the human subarachnoid space, causing an eosinophilic inflammatory response.
