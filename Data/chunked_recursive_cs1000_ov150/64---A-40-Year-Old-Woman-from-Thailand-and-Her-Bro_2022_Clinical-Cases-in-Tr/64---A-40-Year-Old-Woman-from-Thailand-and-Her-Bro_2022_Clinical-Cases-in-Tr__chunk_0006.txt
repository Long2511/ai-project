Parasitic infection of the meninges typically results in eosin-ophilic meningitis. The next investigation to perform is a lumbar puncture to confirm meningitis and to look for a pos-sibly eosinophilic profile of inflammation. Eosinophilic meningitis in an otherwise healthy person with positive his-tory of exposure to helminths and features of an outbreak is almost always attributable to a parasitic infestation.
The main differential diagnoses are fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis (in North and Central America), lymphoma, eosinophilic leukaemia, sarcoid and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.
It is important to measure the CSF opening pressure. If it is elevated, serial spinal taps might relieve the symptoms.
