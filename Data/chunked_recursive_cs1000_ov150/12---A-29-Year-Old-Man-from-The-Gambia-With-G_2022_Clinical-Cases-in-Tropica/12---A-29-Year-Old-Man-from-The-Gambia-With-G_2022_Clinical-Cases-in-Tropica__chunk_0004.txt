The patient was treated with 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin IM stat and given erythromycin 500 mg to take qds for 7 days. He was HIV-negative, his syphilis serology was positive (RPR and TPHA). A swab was taken for culture of Haemophilus ducreyi, and H. ducreyi was grown after three days' incubation at 33°C. Mixed infection are common in patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STIs), since for behavioural reasons patients with one STI are at increased risk of others. The patient returned for follow-up after 7 days. The pain had resolved and the ulcers were all healing (Fig. 12.2).

Chancroid is a disease of core groups, principally sex workers and their clients. Unlike other STIs, asymptomatic infection is rare; most infected individuals have painful genital ulcers.
