Laboratory diagnosis of chancroid is difficult. It depends on the identification of the causative agent, H. ducreyi, in material from lesions. Gram stain is neither sensitive nor specific. Nucleic acid amplification tests such as PCR have been used in research settings, but are not commercially available. Isolation is the gold standard. H. ducreyi is a fastidious organism, requiring an enriched culture medium that needs to be made selective by the addition of antibiotics to inhibit the growth of other organisms present in the ulcer. Unlike most bacteria, it grows best at 33°C.

Virtually all strains of H. ducreyi are resistant to penicillin, because of plasmids encoding various penicillin resistance genes. Most strains are also resistant to tetracyclines and sulphonamides. Treatment for chancroid is with azithromycin 1 g PO or ciprofloxacin 500mg bid for 3 days or erythromycin 500 mg qds for 7 days.
