The three major causes of genital ulceration are Herpes simplex, syphilis and chancroid. Ulcers caused by H. simplex are self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, and do not usually last longer than a few days. They can be severe and persistent in the immunocompromised. Ulcers caused by primary syphilis are usually painless, and it is unusual for there to be more than a single ulcer. Inguinal adenopathy is sometimes seen but is usually painless. Ulcers caused by chancroid are often multiple, and usually painful. In some 50% of cases painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is found. Inguinal buboes may be fluctuant and sometimes rupture, releasing large amounts of pus.

However, the clinical diagnosis of genital ulcer disease is unreliable. For this reason, the patient should be treated syndromically for both syphilis and chancroid. If he is HIV-positive, additional treatment for herpes should also be considered.
