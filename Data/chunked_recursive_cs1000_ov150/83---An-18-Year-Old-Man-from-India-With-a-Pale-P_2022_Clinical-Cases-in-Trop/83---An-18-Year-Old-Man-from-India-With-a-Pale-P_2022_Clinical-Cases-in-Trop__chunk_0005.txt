Individuals with high cell-mediated immunity develop tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Bacteria are usually not seen in the skin biopsies or slit-skin smears of these individuals. Individuals who do not mount a cell-mediated response to M. leprae develop lepromatous leprosy with infiltration of the skin and many skin lesions. These individuals have lots of bacteria in their skin and nasal secretions.
