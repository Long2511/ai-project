No additional investigations are required because the patient has the two clinical cardinal signs of leprosy – a hypopigmented skin lesion with reduced sensation and a thickened nerve. However, where available, clinicians may elect to perform a skin biopsy and slit-skin smears. In this case a skin biopsy is likely to show granulomatous dermatitis with destruction of cutaneous nerves and a slit-skin smear is likely to be negative.

The patient was diagnosed with paucibacillary leprosy and commenced on rifampicin and dapsone which he took for 6 months. The sensory neuropathy was treated with oral prednisolone 30 mg daily which was reduced by 5 mg each month. The patient was counselled extensively about the cause of leprosy and that he was not an infection risk to his family or friends, who were examined and had no signs of leprosy. He was advised how to care for his hands and avoid trauma. He made a full recovery.
