An 18-year-old man from India presents with a hypopigmented macular lesion on the right arm with reduced sensation. A hypopigmented anaesthetic patch is a cardinal sign of leprosy. The combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy should always raise the suspicion of leprosy.

Hypopigmented skin lesions are very common. Hypopigmentation may be a non-specific sequela of any inflammatory or traumatic process such as dermatitis or a burn.

Common causes of hypopigmentation include pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Vitiligo causes depigmentation rather than hypopigmentation. In leprosy-endemic countries any skin problem causing reduced pigmentation may cause an individual to seek advice because of concern about leprosy. Leprosy awareness campaigns often advise people to get pale patches checked.
