The World Health Organization categorises leprosy according to the number of skin lesions for the purpose of treatment with multi-drug therapy. Individuals with paucibacillary leprosy are treated for 6 months and those with multibacillary leprosy for 12 months. In 2018, the WHO recommended that all leprosy patients receive treatment with three drugs. The WHO regime is rifampicin 600 mg, clofazimine 300 mg, dapsone 100 mg once per month and dapsone 100 mg and clofazimine 50 mg daily on the other days. Prior to this, patients with paucibacillary leprosy received two drugs (dapsone and rifampicin) for 6 months. Multi-drug therapy is provided free of charge to patients.

Individuals with recent onset of sensory or motor loss are treated with oral corticosteroids, in addition to multi-drug therapy, to improve nerve function. In rare circumstances leprosy may manifest without skin changes - pure neural leprosy - which makes the diagnosis challenging.
