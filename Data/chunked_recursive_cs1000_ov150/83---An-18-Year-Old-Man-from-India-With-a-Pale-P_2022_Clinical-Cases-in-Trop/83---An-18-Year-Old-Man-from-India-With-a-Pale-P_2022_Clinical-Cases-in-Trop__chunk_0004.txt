According to the WHO classification of leprosy, the paucibacillary classification, which is defined by having fewer than five patches, requires a treatment duration of 6 months.

The WHO treatment for leprosy as of 2018 specifies that once a month, a patient receives 600 mg of Rifampicin, 300 mg of Clofazimine, and 100 mg of Dapsone. On all other days, the patient receives a daily dose of 50 mg of Clofazimine and 100 mg of Dapsone.

Leprosy is a disease predominantly of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The organisms cannot be grown in culture. The vast majority of individuals exposed to the infection do not develop clinical disease, but those who do develop a variety of clinical signs determined by their immunological response to the bacteria.
