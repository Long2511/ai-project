An 18-year-old man from India has noticed a pale patch on his right arm and forearm for 3 months. It is not itchy or painful, but he reports reduced sensation in the affected area. He also complains of mild numbness of the little finger of the right hand but no weakness (he is right-handed). Otherwise he is well. There is no family history of skin problems.

There is a 20 cm by 10 cm hypopigmented macule on the outer aspect of the right arm extending on to the forearm. The affected skin is dry. The sensation within the hypopigmented area is reduced compared with the normally pigmented skin. The rest of the skin examination is normal. Both ulnar nerves are palpable, however the right ulnar nerve is thickened. There is reduced sensation on the tip and ulnar border of the right little finger. There are no other neurological abnormalities.
