A 12-year-old Kenyan boy from a pastoralist community in an arid area presents with painful, red eyes, discharge and poor vision. He has a history of using traditional eye medicine. On examination he has lid, conjunctival and corneal scarring associated with severe follicular inflammation and trichiasis (in-turning lashes). One eye has a perforated corneal ulcer with scarred iris adhesion (leucoma).

The most important diagnoses to consider are:
1. Corneal and conjunctival damage from use of traditional eye medicine.
2. Trachomatous trichiasis.
3. Vitamin A deficiency.
Further useful information includes dietary intake, history of measles predisposing to vitamin A deficiency and ideally blood retinol (vitamin A) levels (this only drops once hepatic stores of vitamin A are severely depleted).
