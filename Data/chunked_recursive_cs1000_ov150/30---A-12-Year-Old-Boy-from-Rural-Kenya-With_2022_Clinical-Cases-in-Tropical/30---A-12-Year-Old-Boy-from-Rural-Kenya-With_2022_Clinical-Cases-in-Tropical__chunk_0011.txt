Both tetracyclines and macrolides are effective against trachoma in its acute stage (TF and TI). Tetracycline ointment can be applied twice daily for 6 weeks. However, adherence to this treatment is poor. A single oral dose of azithromycin is equally effective and more convenient (20mg/kg for children, 1 g for adults). The WHO recommends 3 years of annual azithromycin as part of a trachoma control programme in communities where active trachoma is present in >10% of children. However, without additional environmental and economic improvement antibiotic treatment will not have a permanent effect. Communities need to secure suitable water supply, build and use well-designed latrines, safely dispose of rubbish and house animals apart from the family home.
