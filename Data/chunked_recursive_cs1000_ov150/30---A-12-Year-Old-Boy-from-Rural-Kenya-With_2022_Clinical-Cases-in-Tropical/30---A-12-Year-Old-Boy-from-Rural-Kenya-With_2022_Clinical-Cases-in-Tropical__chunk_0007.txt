The child was diagnosed with bilateral trachomatous trichiasis (TT), corneal opacity (CO) and a left perforating corneal ulcer. These may have been exacerbated by the application of traditional medicine.

He was admitted and given oral azithromycin and oral vitamin A supplements. He was referred to the ophthalmol-ogist for lid surgery to redress trichiasis, and for a conjunc-tival flap to seal the corneal defect.

Trachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world. It accounts for about 1.4% of the world's blindness, but rates in affected communities in Africa are much higher. In endemic areas, active trachoma prevalence in pre-school children can be as high as 60% to 90%.
