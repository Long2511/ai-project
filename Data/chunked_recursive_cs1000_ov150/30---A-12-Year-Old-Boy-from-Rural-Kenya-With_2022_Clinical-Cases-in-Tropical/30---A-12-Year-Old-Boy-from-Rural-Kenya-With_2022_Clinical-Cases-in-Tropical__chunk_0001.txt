A 12-year-old boy is brought to a health centre in rural north-west Kenya. He reports 2 months of painful, watery, red eyes. The watering of his eyes is worse in the sun and he is struggling to keep his eyes open.

Six months previously he was treated at a dispensary for less severe symptoms. He was given tetracycline eye ointment but his symptoms did not improve. After this, he went to a traditional healer who applied some juice extracts from the ecucuka plant (Aloe vera species). After instillation he experienced severe eye pain and discharge, both eyes became very red and he could hardly see.

The boy lives with his parents in Loima, Turkana County, a hot, dusty and dry area of Kenya. They fetch water from a dried riverbed about 6 kilometres from home. They keep herds of cows and sheep, and the boy helps with herding and watering.
