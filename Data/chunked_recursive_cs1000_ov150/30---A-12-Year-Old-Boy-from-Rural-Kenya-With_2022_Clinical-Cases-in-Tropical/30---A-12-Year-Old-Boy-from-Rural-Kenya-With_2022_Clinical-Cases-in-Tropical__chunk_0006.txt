For the diagnosis of trachoma, two out of five clinical criteria need to be fulfilled. This boy has all five criteria:
1. Follicles on the tarsal (inner) conjunctiva. These are 0.5 to 2 mm pale, raised inflammatory foci with hyperaemic surround. Multiple follicles give a rough or dimpled appearance to the surface of the conjunctiva.
2. Conjunctival scarring of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. White bands or strands evident on everting (flipping) the upper eyelid which can also sometimes be seen on the inner lower lid.
3. Limbal follicles or Herbert's pits. Follicles can occur at the edge of the cornea (limbus), and they leave 0.5 to 2 mm dark circular lesions (Herbert's pits).
4. Fibrovascular pannus, mostly affecting the upper cornea. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue from the limbus ruining the transparency of the cornea.
5. Trichiasis on the upper lid. In-turning of the lashes so they scuff the cornea.
