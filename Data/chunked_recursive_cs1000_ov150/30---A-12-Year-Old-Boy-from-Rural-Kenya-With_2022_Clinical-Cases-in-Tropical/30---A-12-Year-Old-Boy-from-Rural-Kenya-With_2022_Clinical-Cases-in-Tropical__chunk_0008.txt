Trachoma is common in poor rural communities, where there is scarcity of water, poor sanitation and low socioeconomic status. The spread occurs because of overcrowding within households. Women are affected more than men and younger children are at greater risk of infection, especially children under 5 years old.

After repeated infections in childhood, signs of trachoma progress from conjunctival inflammation to scarring. Scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva leads to inversion of the lid resulting in trichiasis. Repetitive damage and infections lead to corneal scarring and consequent visual impairment or blindness.
