He reports 2 months of painful, watery, red eyes. The watering of his eyes is worse in the sun and he is struggling to keep his eyes open.\n\nSix months previously he was treated at a dispensary for less severe symptoms. He was given tetracycline eye ointment but his symptoms did not improve. After this, he went to a traditional healer who applied some juice extracts from the ecucuka plant (Aloe vera species). After instillation he experienced severe eye pain and discharge, both eyes became very red and he could hardly see.\n\nThe boy lives with his parents in Loima, Turkana County, a hot, dusty and dry area of Kenya. They fetch water from a dried riverbed about 6 kilometres from home. They keep herds of cows and sheep, and the boy helps with herding and watering."}

The left eye presented with swollen lids, mucus deposits, misdirected eyelashes, and eversion of the lower lid margin. The conjunctiva of the right eye was severely inflamed with more than five follicles identified on eversion of the lids and scarring of the upper tarsal conjunctivae. The cornea of the right eye showed diffuse corneal opacification or scarring with central thinning, an irregular surface, and a fibrovascular pannus on the upper cornea. The left cornea had focal inferocentral corneal scars, one with an adherent iris indicating a previous perforation, and a thin central cornea. The anterior chamber of the right eye was not visible, while in the left eye, it was shallow"}

He has a history of using traditional eye medicine. On examination he has lid, conjunctival and corneal scarring associated with severe follicular inflammation and trichiasis (in-turning lashes). One eye has a perforated corneal ulcer with scarred iris adhesion (leucoma).\n\nThe most important diagnoses to consider are:\n1. Corneal and conjunctival damage from use of traditional eye medicine.\n2. Trachomatous trichiasis.\n3. Vitamin A deficiency.\nFurther useful information includes dietary intake, history of measles predisposing to vitamin A deficiency and ideally blood retinol (vitamin A) levels (this only drops once hepatic stores of vitamin A are severely depleted)."}

This boy has all five criteria:\n1. Follicles on the tarsal (inner) conjunctiva. These are 0.5 to 2 mm pale, raised inflammatory foci with hyperaemic surround. Multiple follicles give a rough or dimpled appearance to the surface of the conjunctiva.\n2. Conjunctival scarring of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. White bands or strands evident on everting (flipping) the upper eyelid which can also sometimes be seen on the inner lower lid.\n3. Limbal follicles or Herbert's pits. Follicles can occur at the edge of the cornea (limbus), and they leave 0.5 to 2 mm dark circular lesions (Herbert's pits).\n4. Fibrovascular pannus, mostly affecting the upper cornea. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue from the limbus ruining the transparency of the cornea.\n5. Trichiasis on the upper lid. In-turning of the lashes so they scuff the cornea."}

He was referred to the ophthalmol-ogist for lid surgery to redress trichiasis, and for a conjunc-tival flap to seal the corneal defect.\n\nTrachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world. It accounts for about 1.4% of the world's blindness, but rates in affected communities in Africa are much higher. In endemic areas, active trachoma prevalence in pre-school children can be as high as 60% to 90%."}

The spread occurs because of overcrowding within households. Women are affected more than men and younger children are at greater risk of infection, especially children under 5 years old.\n\nAfter repeated infections in childhood, signs of trachoma progress from conjunctival inflammation to scarring. Scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva leads to inversion of the lid resulting in trichiasis. Repetitive damage and infections lead to corneal scarring and consequent visual impairment or blindness."}

Tetracycline ointment can be applied twice daily for 6 weeks. However, adherence to this treatment is poor. A single oral dose of azithromycin is equally effective and more convenient (20mg/kg for children, 1 g for adults). The WHO recommends 3 years of annual azithromycin as part of a trachoma control programme in communities where active trachoma is present in >10% of children. However, without additional environmental and economic improvement antibiotic treatment will not have a permanent effect. Communities need to secure suitable water supply, build and use well-designed latrines, safely dispose of rubbish and house animals apart from the family home."}
