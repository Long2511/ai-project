A simplified scheme for assessing and classifying trachoma based on clinical signs has been developed. The stages are:
Trachomatous inflammation with follicles (TF)
Intense trachomatous inflammation (TI)
Trachomatous conjunctival scarring (TS)
Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and
Corneal opacity because of trachoma (CO).
TF and TI are prevalent in young children and are manifestations of moderate and severe active infection, while TT is common in adults.
