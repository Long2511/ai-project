He has also noticed that his neck has swollen and is painful. There are no other symptoms. He has never been admitted to a hospital but has been tested HIV positive and was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 2 months earlier at a nearby health centre. His health passport reveals that a recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL and that the patient had been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\n\nHe looks moderately ill, is pale, is sweating and has a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), pulse 112bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and normal blood pressure. There are large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. The rest of the examination is unremarkable."}

His haemoglobin was low at 6.3 g/dL, compared to the normal range of 13-15, and his mean corpuscular volume was also low at 66 fL, against a normal range of 80-98. His platelet count was normal at 246 × 10^9 per liter, within the reference range of 150–350.\n\nThree sputum samples are negative for AFB. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yields purulent material. Microscopy for AFB is 2+ positive. There is no growth on blood culture.\n\nThe patient is admitted to the hospital and started on TB repeat treatment for tuberculous lymphadenitis with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, while continuing the same ART. Against expectation, he does not improve after 3 weeks. He still has fevers, night sweats, lack of appetite and the glands in the neck have further swollen and are now clearly fluctuant."}

The TB diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. He unexpectedly deteriorates on antituberculous treatment.\n\nAlthough the diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis is very likely when AFB are identified in a lymph gland sample, atypical mycobacteria should also be considered now that the initial response to TB treatment is unsatisfactory, especially given the deep immune suppression the patient had at the start of ART. Other reasons for a poor response to TB treatment are non-adherence, malabsorption and drug resistance. Given the frank fluctuation that is present, a bacterial lymphadenitis is probable, whereas a lymphoma seems much less likely."}

A repeat FNA should be performed to check for AFB. A Gram stain and bacterial culture should help rule out bacterial superinfection. Ideally, the aspirate should be examined by PCR (XPert MTB/RIF) and also be cultured to rule out infection with resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria (culture).\n\nThe patient denied missing any tablets, had no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and had not left Malawi, where multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. IRIS of the paradoxical type was also considered to explain the lack of improvement, therefore corticosteroids were initiated.\n\nFurther investigations were done, showing a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an HIV-1 RNA level below 400 copies/mL. Repeat full blood count results showed a white blood cell count of 7.8 × 10^9/L, a haemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, an MCV of 84 fL, and a platelet count of 428 × 10^9/L."}

On microscopic examination, numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes were observed. Unfortunately results from a bacterial culture were never received. The diagnosis at this point was superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic because of the earlier aspiration, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most likely microorganism. The patient recovered well after incision and drainage, antibiotic treatment and a short course of corticosteroids while he continued on TB treatment and ART."}

Anaemia is extremely common in patients with advanced HIV immunosuppression and TB co-infection; however, the marked microcytosis is unusual. There was no good explanation for this finding because there was no source of blood loss in the history, and the MCV had normalized in the second full blood count, which was against ß-thalassaemia as a cause of microcytic anaemia. The first full blood count also showed a leukocytosis when TB lymphadenitis was diagnosed. This finding is paradoxical because later, when the florid purulent bacterial infection was present, it had resolved. Multiple dynamic factors were apparently influencing the white blood cell count in this patient, including HIV, TB, bacterial infection, immune reconstitution, corticosteroids, antiretroviral and antituberculous drugs and co-trimoxazole."}

In sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis are the two most important IRIS presentations. IRIS is very common, occurring in between 10 and 25% of patients who start ART. There are no validated tests for IRIS. The diagnosis is therefore clinical.\n\nA widely accepted definition does not exist, although standardization has been attempted. Definitions include measures of successful ART, exclusion of other causes of the clinical deterioration, such as toxicity, and a relationship in time between the symptoms and the start of ART."}
{"id": "47---A-32-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-Pain_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic__0008", "text": "IRIS is classified into two types: In \"unmasking IRIS\", a condition is present but remains subclinical and undiagnosed because of severe immunosuppression before the start of ART, and becomes clinically apparent within 6 months after ART initiation. In \"paradoxical IRIS\", a condition has been diagnosed and is being treated successfully, but clinical worsening occurs because of the increased inflammation after immune recovery, e.g. after starting ART. Risk factors for HIV-associated paradoxical IRIS include a low pre-ART CD4 count and haemoglobin level, a high pre-ART viral load, large pre-ART weight loss, large and rapid increase of the CD4 count, rapid reduction of the viral load on ART and a short period between the start of treatment for an opportunistic infection and initiation of ART. Prednisone initiated alongside ART in selected patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/µL seems to reduce the risk of paradoxical IRIS and is not associated with significant adverse effects."}

Patients have to be prepared for the IRIS phenomenon when starting treatment."}
