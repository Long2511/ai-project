HIV viral load and a CD4 count should be done to determine the response to ART. A repeat FNA should be performed to check for AFB. A Gram stain and bacterial culture should help rule out bacterial superinfection. Ideally, the aspirate should be examined by PCR (XPert MTB/RIF) and also be cultured to rule out infection with resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria (culture).

The patient denied missing any tablets, had no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and had not left Malawi, where multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. IRIS of the paradoxical type was also considered to explain the lack of improvement, therefore corticosteroids were initiated.

Further investigations were done, showing a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an HIV-1 RNA level below 400 copies/mL. Repeat full blood count results showed a white blood cell count of 7.8 × 10^9/L, a haemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, an MCV of 84 fL, and a platelet count of 428 × 10^9/L.
