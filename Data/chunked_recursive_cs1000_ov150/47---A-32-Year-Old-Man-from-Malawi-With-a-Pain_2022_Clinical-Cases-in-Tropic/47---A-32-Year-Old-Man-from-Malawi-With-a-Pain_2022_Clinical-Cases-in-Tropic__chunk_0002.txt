A full blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 14.3 × 10^9 per liter, compared to the reference range of 4-10. His haemoglobin was low at 6.3 g/dL, compared to the normal range of 13-15, and his mean corpuscular volume was also low at 66 fL, against a normal range of 80-98. His platelet count was normal at 246 × 10^9 per liter, within the reference range of 150–350.

Three sputum samples are negative for AFB. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yields purulent material. Microscopy for AFB is 2+ positive. There is no growth on blood culture.

The patient is admitted to the hospital and started on TB repeat treatment for tuberculous lymphadenitis with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, while continuing the same ART. Against expectation, he does not improve after 3 weeks. He still has fevers, night sweats, lack of appetite and the glands in the neck have further swollen and are now clearly fluctuant.
