A 32-year-old Malawian man presents to the outpatient department of a local tertiary hospital with a 6-week history of productive cough and chest pain associated with weight loss, fevers and night sweats. He has also noticed that his neck has swollen and is painful. There are no other symptoms. He has never been admitted to a hospital but has been tested HIV positive and was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 2 months earlier at a nearby health centre. His health passport reveals that a recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL and that the patient had been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.

He looks moderately ill, is pale, is sweating and has a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), pulse 112bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and normal blood pressure. There are large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.
