IRIS is classified into two types: In "unmasking IRIS", a condition is present but remains subclinical and undiagnosed because of severe immunosuppression before the start of ART, and becomes clinically apparent within 6 months after ART initiation. In "paradoxical IRIS", a condition has been diagnosed and is being treated successfully, but clinical worsening occurs because of the increased inflammation after immune recovery, e.g. after starting ART. Risk factors for HIV-associated paradoxical IRIS include a low pre-ART CD4 count and haemoglobin level, a high pre-ART viral load, large pre-ART weight loss, large and rapid increase of the CD4 count, rapid reduction of the viral load on ART and a short period between the start of treatment for an opportunistic infection and initiation of ART. Prednisone initiated alongside ART in selected patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/µL seems to reduce the risk of paradoxical IRIS and is not associated with significant adverse effects.
