Because of the increasingly fluctuant swelling in the neck, a second FNA was done, now showing frank yellowish pus. On microscopic examination, numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes were observed. Unfortunately results from a bacterial culture were never received. The diagnosis at this point was superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic because of the earlier aspiration, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most likely microorganism. The patient recovered well after incision and drainage, antibiotic treatment and a short course of corticosteroids while he continued on TB treatment and ART.
