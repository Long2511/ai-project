In the first full blood count, severe microcytic anaemia was present. Anaemia is extremely common in patients with advanced HIV immunosuppression and TB co-infection; however, the marked microcytosis is unusual. There was no good explanation for this finding because there was no source of blood loss in the history, and the MCV had normalized in the second full blood count, which was against ß-thalassaemia as a cause of microcytic anaemia. The first full blood count also showed a leukocytosis when TB lymphadenitis was diagnosed. This finding is paradoxical because later, when the florid purulent bacterial infection was present, it had resolved. Multiple dynamic factors were apparently influencing the white blood cell count in this patient, including HIV, TB, bacterial infection, immune reconstitution, corticosteroids, antiretroviral and antituberculous drugs and co-trimoxazole.
