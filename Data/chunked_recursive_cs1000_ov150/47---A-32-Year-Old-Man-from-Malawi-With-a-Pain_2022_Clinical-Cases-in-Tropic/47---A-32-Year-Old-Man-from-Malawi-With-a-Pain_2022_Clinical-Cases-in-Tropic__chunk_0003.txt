A 32-year-old Malawian man who is known to be HIV positive is admitted with a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) of the unmasking type. The TB diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. He unexpectedly deteriorates on antituberculous treatment.

Although the diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis is very likely when AFB are identified in a lymph gland sample, atypical mycobacteria should also be considered now that the initial response to TB treatment is unsatisfactory, especially given the deep immune suppression the patient had at the start of ART. Other reasons for a poor response to TB treatment are non-adherence, malabsorption and drug resistance. Given the frank fluctuation that is present, a bacterial lymphadenitis is probable, whereas a lymphoma seems much less likely.
