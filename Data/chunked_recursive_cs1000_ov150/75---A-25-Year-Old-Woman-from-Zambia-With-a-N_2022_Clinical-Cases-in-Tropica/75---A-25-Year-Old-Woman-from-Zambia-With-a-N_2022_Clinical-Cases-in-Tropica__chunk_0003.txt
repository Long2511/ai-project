A lumbar puncture is done. The opening pressure is normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is clear. CSF results are shown. The CSF results on admission showed 5 leukocytes per microliter, which is within the normal range of 0-5. The CSF protein was elevated at 0.78 g/L, compared to a reference range of 0.25-0.55. CSF glucose was 2.9 mmol/L, within the reference range of 2.25-2.97. Tests for Cryptococcal antigen, India Ink stain, Gram stain, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain were all negative, as expected for a normal result.

Electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrates focal slowing in the right hemisphere (Fig. 75.1). A CT scan of her brain shows frontal and parietal hypodense lesions in the white matter of the right hemisphere (Fig. 75.2). No contrast enhancement is present.
