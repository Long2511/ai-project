Treatment should aim at both preventing further seizures (antiepileptic treatment) and managing the underlying condition (causative treatment). The patient and her guardians should be counselled about the nature of her epileptic disorder, respecting their beliefs and attitudes. The choice for an antiepileptic drug should take into account the local availability and costs for the patient. Phenobarbitone is the most widely available and most affordable drug in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by carbamazepine. Newer drugs with fewer interactions and a better side effect profile, such as levetiracetam, are not yet routinely available. Phenytoin and valproic acid are also used but their delivery might be unreliable. Reliability of supply is an important factor to consider, because the discontinuation of the antiepileptic medication might put the patient at risk of withdrawal seizures
