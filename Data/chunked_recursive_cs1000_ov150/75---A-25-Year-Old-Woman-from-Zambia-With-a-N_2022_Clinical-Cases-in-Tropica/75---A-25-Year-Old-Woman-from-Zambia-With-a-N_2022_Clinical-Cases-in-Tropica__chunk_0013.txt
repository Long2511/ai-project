The patient was started on carbamazepine 200 mg bid. Valproic acid was initially requested but the patient could not afford it.

JC-virus DNA was later detected in the CSF as part of a research study, further confirming the suspected diagnosis of PML. She was commenced on ART and remained on carbamazepine. After 6 months, she remained seizure-free and carbamazepine was stopped. After 1 year of ART, the patient's CD4 count reached 535 cells/µL and she had returned to work.
