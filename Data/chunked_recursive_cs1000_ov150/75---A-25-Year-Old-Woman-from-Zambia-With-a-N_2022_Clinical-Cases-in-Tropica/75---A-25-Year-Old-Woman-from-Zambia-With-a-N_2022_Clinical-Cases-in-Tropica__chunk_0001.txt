A 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman is referred from a health centre to a local teaching hospital in Lusaka after suffering her first ever seizure. The seizure occurred out of sleep. Her son walked into her bedroom after hearing a noise and found his mother on the floor unresponsive and shaking all four limbs. This continued for 5 to 10 minutes.

The patient had been diagnosed with HIV infection 1 month earlier. She is not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART) but has been taking co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for 7 days. She was successfully treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 4 years ago.

The patient is unmarried with three children. She works in the hospital cafeteria. She does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs.

On examination she looks well, her GCS score is 15/15, her vital signs are normal and she is afebrile. There is no meningism. The chest is clear. The neurological examination is unremarkable.
