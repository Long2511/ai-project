HIV patients are at risk for developing seizures related to HIV-associated neurological diseases and metabolic disturbances. The decision to initiate AEDs in an HIV patient with seizures depends on their aetiology and the duration for which the patient remains at risk for seizure activity. If the cause is readily reversible, such as hypoglycemia, there is no need to initiate antiepileptic treatment. If the patient has a seizure related to a reversible process of medium duration such as an opportunistic infection (OI), it is reasonable to initiate an AED and continue it for 3 to 6 months after treatment for the OI has been completed. If a patient develops persistent seizure activity without a reversible cause, then a diagnosis of epilepsy should be given and long-term AED will be required.
