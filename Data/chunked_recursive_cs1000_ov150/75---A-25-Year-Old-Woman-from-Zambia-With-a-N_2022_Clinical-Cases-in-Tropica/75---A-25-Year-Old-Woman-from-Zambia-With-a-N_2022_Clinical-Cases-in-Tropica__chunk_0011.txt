Treatment of women of child-bearing age might pose some additional challenges. In all women of child-bearing age, folic acid (5 mg/day) should be added to the regimen. AEDs recommended for women of child-bearing age in resource-rich settings with low HIV prevalence, such as lamotrigine, are not available in sub-Saharan Africa and might have adverse interactions with ARVs, especially protease inhibitors. In those cases where several AEDs are available, the specific drug chosen for epilepsy treatment of a woman of child-bearing age will be a trade-off between the health of the fetus and that of the mother. Here, one should consider that leaving out a drug because of its possible fetal toxicity, such as valproic acid, and using an enzyme-inducing drug with a better record regarding foetal malformations instead, might lead to a virological failure that would jeopardize both the mother and the child.
