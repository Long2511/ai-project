In all patients with unknown HIV status, HIV testing should be performed. In all febrile patients, a CNS infection including cerebral malaria should be ruled out. Opportunistic CNS infections should be considered in immunosuppressed patients. In areas with high prevalence of T. solium, neurocysticercosis should be taken into consideration. In view of the limited resources, the diagnosis will be based on clinical and epidemiological evidence; hence, the knowledge of local distribution and prevalence of possible causes is helpful.

When initiating antiepileptic treatment, the issues of availability, including reliability of supply, affordability and interactions between AEDs and the patient's medications, must be taken into consideration (particularly, antiretrovirals, antituberculous drugs and contraceptives).
