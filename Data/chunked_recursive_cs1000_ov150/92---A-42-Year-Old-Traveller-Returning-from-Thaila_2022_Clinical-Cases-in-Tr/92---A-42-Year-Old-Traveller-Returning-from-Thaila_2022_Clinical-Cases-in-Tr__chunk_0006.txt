To reliably rule out dengue and indeed any of the arboviral infections, serology at this point is the diagnostic test of choice, because viraemia is short and IgM should be positive by day 6 of fever. Convalescent samples taken 10 to 14 days later should show a further rise in titres.

For diagnosis of influenza a deep nasopharyngeal swab should be obtained, and care must be taken to apply the correct technique. For acute HIV infection fourth-generation diagnostic tests which include p24 antigen, should be able to diagnose acute infection. Western Blot may still be negative at this stage, but in case of doubt, HIV PCR would help establish the diagnosis. Blood cultures would be the appropriate test to rule out enteric fever.

For malaria, microscopy (thick and thin films) remains the diagnostic gold standard. Three negative films taken on consecutive days are considered to safely rule out malaria.
