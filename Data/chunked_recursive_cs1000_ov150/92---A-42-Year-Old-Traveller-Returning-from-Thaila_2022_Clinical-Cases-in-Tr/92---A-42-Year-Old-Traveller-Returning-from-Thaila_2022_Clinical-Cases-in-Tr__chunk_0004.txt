Influenza is another important differential diagnosis to have in this patient. Fever and associated symptoms are usually of shorter duration but may last as long as 8 days. Acute HIV infection may present with persistent fever and thrombocytopenia, and possible exposures should definitely be inquired. Enteric fever presents with persistent febrile temperatures and otherwise non-specific symptoms. Because food hygiene in Thailand is overall very good, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are nowadays rarely seen imported from this country. Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile traveller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocytopenia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays rarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however, overlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are of unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum malaria
