A thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. On thin film however, the microscopist on duty was unable to determine the Plasmodium species. Based on the negative result of the rapid diagnostic test, non-falciparum malaria was suspected. The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment was started with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets once daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was discharged on the fourth day. For further parasite differentiation, malaria microscopy was repeated by the head parasitologist. After intense reading of the Giemsa-stained thin blood film, 2 parasite-infected erythrocytes were identified with morphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium malariae or P. knowlesi infection. Subsequently, species-specific PCR confirmed the presence of a mono-infection with P. knowlesi.
