Given the clinical syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, arthralgias and thrombocytopenia after a visit to Thailand, the most likely differential diagnosis to suspect is dengue fever. Dengue is the most common febrile tropical disease seen in returning travellers from South and South-east Asia. The duration of fever, however, is borderline long for dengue. The dengue NS1 antigen test reflecting dengue viraemia may already be negative at day 6 and does not reliably rule out the infection. Chikungunya and Zika are additional important arboviral infections to suspect.
