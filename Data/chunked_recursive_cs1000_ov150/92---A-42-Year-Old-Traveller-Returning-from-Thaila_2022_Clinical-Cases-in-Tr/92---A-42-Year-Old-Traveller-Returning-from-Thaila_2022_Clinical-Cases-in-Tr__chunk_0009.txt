P. knowlesi is primarily a zoonotic parasite reported increasingly in humans across South-east Asia. Its reservoir is in various species of macaques.

Knowlesi malaria is now recognized as the most common form of malaria in Malaysia and parts of western Indonesia and it is increasingly reported from other parts of South-east Asia.

Its prevalence may have long been underestimated because of the inability to reliably distinguish P. knowlesi from other Plasmodium species, in particular P. malariae. PCR-based methods have been a major breakthrough in recognizing the importance of P. knowlesi. Rapid diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and specificity for this parasite, and physicians practising in the region or seeing returned travellers from South-east Asia need to be aware of these pitfalls.
