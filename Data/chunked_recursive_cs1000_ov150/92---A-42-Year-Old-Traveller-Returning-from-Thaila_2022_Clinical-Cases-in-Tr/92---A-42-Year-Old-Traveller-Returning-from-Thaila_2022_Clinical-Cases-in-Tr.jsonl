For the past 6 days he has had a fever of up to 40°C (104°F), arthralgias and retro-orbital pain.\n\nThe day before presentation, he returned from a 10-week trip to Thailand, where he had spent 2 months on Little Koh Chang, an island in the Andaman Sea. After that, he spent 5 days in Hua Hin at the Gulf of Thailand and another 5 days in Bangkok. He has not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, which is in line with the national recommendations in his home country for this trip.\n\nHis past medical is unremarkable.\n\nOn examination, GCS is 15/15, Temperature 39.1°C (102.4°F), BP 156/80 mmHg, pulse 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breath cycles per minute, SpO2 95% on ambient air. There is no skin rash and no lymphadenopathy. Upon auscultation, his chest is clear. Abdominal examination does not show any intercostal tenderness, no tenderness on palpation and no organomegaly."}

Dengue is the most common febrile tropical disease seen in returning travellers from South and South-east Asia. The duration of fever, however, is borderline long for dengue. The dengue NS1 antigen test reflecting dengue viraemia may already be negative at day 6 and does not reliably rule out the infection. Chikungunya and Zika are additional important arboviral infections to suspect."}

Fever and associated symptoms are usually of shorter duration but may last as long as 8 days. Acute HIV infection may present with persistent fever and thrombocytopenia, and possible exposures should definitely be inquired. Enteric fever presents with persistent febrile temperatures and otherwise non-specific symptoms. Because food hygiene in Thailand is overall very good, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are nowadays rarely seen imported from this country. Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile traveller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocytopenia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays rarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however, overlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are of unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum malaria"}

Convalescent samples taken 10 to 14 days later should show a further rise in titres.\n\nFor diagnosis of influenza a deep nasopharyngeal swab should be obtained, and care must be taken to apply the correct technique. For acute HIV infection fourth-generation diagnostic tests which include p24 antigen, should be able to diagnose acute infection. Western Blot may still be negative at this stage, but in case of doubt, HIV PCR would help establish the diagnosis. Blood cultures would be the appropriate test to rule out enteric fever.\n\nFor malaria, microscopy (thick and thin films) remains the diagnostic gold standard. Three negative films taken on consecutive days are considered to safely rule out malaria."}

On thin film however, the microscopist on duty was unable to determine the Plasmodium species. Based on the negative result of the rapid diagnostic test, non-falciparum malaria was suspected. The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment was started with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets once daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was discharged on the fourth day. For further parasite differentiation, malaria microscopy was repeated by the head parasitologist. After intense reading of the Giemsa-stained thin blood film, 2 parasite-infected erythrocytes were identified with morphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium malariae or P. knowlesi infection. Subsequently, species-specific PCR confirmed the presence of a mono-infection with P. knowlesi."}

Its reservoir is in various species of macaques.\n\nKnowlesi malaria is now recognized as the most common form of malaria in Malaysia and parts of western Indonesia and it is increasingly reported from other parts of South-east Asia.\n\nIts prevalence may have long been underestimated because of the inability to reliably distinguish P. knowlesi from other Plasmodium species, in particular P. malariae. PCR-based methods have been a major breakthrough in recognizing the importance of P. knowlesi. Rapid diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and specificity for this parasite, and physicians practising in the region or seeing returned travellers from South-east Asia need to be aware of these pitfalls."}

It may cause severe disease, similar to falciparum malaria. Treatment is the same as for acute falciparum malaria."}
