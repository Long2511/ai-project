Anthrax is caused by B. anthracis, a Gram-positive rod that forms spores under certain environmental conditions. It is primarily a zoonotic disease affecting domestic and wild herbivores. Anthrax remains endemic in animals worldwide, most importantly in Asia, Africa and South-eastern Australia, as well as parts of the southern and western United States. Humans usually acquire the infection when they are exposed to infected animals or animal products, but anthrax has also been used as an agent of bioterrorism. In the developed world, cases usually tend to be sporadic. In resource-limited countries anthrax remains a relevant public health problem and large outbreaks can occasionally occur.
Depending on the route of entry, B. anthracis can cause cutaneous, gastrointestinal or inhalational disease. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form worldwide, accounting for 95% of all human cases. Although only a small percentage develop systemic disease, it can be lethal if not treated quickly.
