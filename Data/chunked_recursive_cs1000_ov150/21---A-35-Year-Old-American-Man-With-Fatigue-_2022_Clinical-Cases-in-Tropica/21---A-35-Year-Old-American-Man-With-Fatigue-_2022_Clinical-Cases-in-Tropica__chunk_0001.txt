A 35-year-old Caucasian male presents to a clinic in the United States with fatigue and a rash on his neck that started as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion is non-pruritic, but it is associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation in the neck. There is no history of fever, but the patient reports at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache.

The patient recalls a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before while shaving and is sure that he has not been bitten by an insect. He has had no contact with animals and no foreign travel within the previous year.

He had come to the clinic 24 hours earlier with similar symptoms. After blood cultures were obtained, he was given one dose of a first-generation cephalosporin and discharged on a ten-day oral course. He returns because of worsening malaise and neck swelling associated with mild difficulty breathing.
