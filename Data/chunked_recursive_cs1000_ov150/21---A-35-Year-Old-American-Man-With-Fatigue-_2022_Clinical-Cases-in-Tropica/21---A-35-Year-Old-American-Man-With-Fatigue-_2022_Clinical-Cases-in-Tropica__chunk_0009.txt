The clinical marker lesion is a painless central ulcer with vesicles and extensive surrounding oedema, but the initial lesion will appear as a non-specific papulovesicular eruption.

History includes recent exposure to infected animals or contaminated animal products, unless the setting is a bioterrorism event, a previous break in the skin at the affected site and the presence of systemic symptoms in disseminated disease. A high index of suspicion is critical to the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax depends on the setting and the individual exposures; it includes bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia and bubonic plague.

Gram stain and culture of affected fluids (blood, skin lesion aspirate, pleural fluid) and paired serological testing for antibodies to protective antigen remain the cornerstone of diagnosis.
