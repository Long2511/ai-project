However, negative cultures do not exclude anthrax. In cutaneous anthrax, full-thickness punch biopsy from the vesicle and eschar should be fixed and sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline should be instituted while awaiting results for limited cutaneous infection. When disseminated infection or other forms of anthrax are suspected, multi-drug therapy that includes those with CNS penetration should be used.
