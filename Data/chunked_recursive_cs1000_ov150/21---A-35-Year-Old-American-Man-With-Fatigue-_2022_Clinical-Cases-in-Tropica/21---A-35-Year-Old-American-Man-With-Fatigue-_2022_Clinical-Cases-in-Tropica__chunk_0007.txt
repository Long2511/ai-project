Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram positive rods. Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion obtained at the second visit were negative for B. anthracis. The patient was admitted and received intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam and recovered. Stains for bacteria and IHC of the skin biopsy performed at a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis and the presence of B. anthracis antigens, respectively. Serology revealed that antibody to protective antigen was present in convalescent serum.

The patient was exposed during his occupation as a postal worker, handling contaminated mail. Overall, 22 cases were identified, of which 11 presented with cutaneous anthrax, and a further 11 fell ill with the inhalational form. Five people died; all deaths occurred secondary to inhalational anthrax.
