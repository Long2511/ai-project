A 35-year-old male postal worker presents to a clinic in the United States with a papulovesicular lesion on his neck associated with massive neck swelling. There is no fever but diaphoresis is present. The patient's condition is worsening despite antibiotic therapy with an oral cephalosporin.

The differential diagnosis of an ulcerative skin lesion with concomitant massive soft tissue swelling and systemic symptoms depends on the epidemiological setting and the individual exposure; it includes bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism (bite by brown recluse spider), rat-bite fevers Streptococcus moniliformis and (Spirillum minus), ulceroglandular tularaemia and bubonic plague.

At the time of the patient’s presentation, the United States was in the process of investigating a possible event of bioterrorism. Therefore the most important, though overall rare, diagnosis to consider was cutaneous anthrax.
