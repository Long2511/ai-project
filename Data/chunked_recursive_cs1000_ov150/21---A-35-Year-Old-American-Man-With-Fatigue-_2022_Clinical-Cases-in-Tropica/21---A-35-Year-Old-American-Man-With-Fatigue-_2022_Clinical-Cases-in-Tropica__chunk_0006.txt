Aspirate of fluid from the skin lesion should be sent for Gram stain, culture and susceptibilities along with blood cultures in patients with systemic symptoms regardless of fever status. In the absence of preceding antimicrobial therapy, numerous Gram-positive rods in high concentration will grow within 24 hours. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline should be instituted while awaiting microbiological results. Because negative cultures do not exclude anthrax, full-thickness punch biopsy from the vesicle and the eschar should be obtained, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and sent to a specialized laboratory for nucleic acid amplification and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to detect Bacillus anthracis antigens. Serum should also be tested for antibodies to the protective antigen at baseline and 4 weeks later.
