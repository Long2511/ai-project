Although 7 to 10 days of antibiotic treatment are usually sufficient in cutaneous anthrax, up to 60 days of antibiotics are needed in inhalational disease because of the possibility of retained ungerminated spores in the lungs. Prevention of anthrax involves either prevention of exposure in occupational settings or immunization. In the setting of a suspected bioterrorism event, those at risk of exposure should receive a 60-day course of postexposure prophylaxis with oral antibiotics.
