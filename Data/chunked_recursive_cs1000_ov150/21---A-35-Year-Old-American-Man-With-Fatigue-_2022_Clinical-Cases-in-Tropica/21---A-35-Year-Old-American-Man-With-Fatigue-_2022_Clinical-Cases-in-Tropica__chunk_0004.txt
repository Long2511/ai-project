There may be few distinguishing features at the time of presentation, depending on the age of the lesion. Although it is commonly known that cutaneous anthrax is manifested by a central black eschar, this is not seen until approximately a week after inoculation. The anthrax lesion begins as a painless papule that lasts 1 to 2 days before becoming a vesicle that later ruptures. It then develops the classic necrotic central ulcer and may be surrounded by smaller peripheral vesicles. Therefore a patient may present with a non-specific localized papulovesicular eruption. Key associated findings include a preceding history of a break in the skin at the affected site, the presence of systemic symptoms such as malaise and headache and extensive, non-tender oedema. Fever and leukocytosis may not be present
