Prompt and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after an exposure from a suspect rabid animal can prevent rabies in almost 100% of cases. True PEP failures are extremely rare and may occur because of short incubation periods resulting from multiple exposures on highly innervated areas of the body like the face, neck, hands etc. or because of direct inoculation of the virus into nerves.
