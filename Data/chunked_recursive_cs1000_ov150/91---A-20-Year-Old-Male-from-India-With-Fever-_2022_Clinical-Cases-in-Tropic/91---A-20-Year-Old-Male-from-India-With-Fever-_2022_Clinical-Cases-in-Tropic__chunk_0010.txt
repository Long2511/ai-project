Tests for the laboratory diagnosis of rabies for an ante-mortem diagnosis can be performed on saliva samples using RT-PCR, which detects viral nucleic acid with moderate to high sensitivity; it is recommended to test serial or pooled samples to increase sensitivity. A nuchal skin biopsy using RT-PCR also detects viral nucleic acid with moderate to high sensitivity, and requires a full thickness biopsy with adequate hair follicles. RT-PCR on CSF or urine to detect viral nucleic acid has low sensitivity. Another ante-mortem test on CSF or serum uses RFFIT, FAVN, or ELISA to detect neutralizing antibodies or antibodies against viral glycoprotein. This test has low sensitivity in the first week of illness but rises with increased duration of survival to over 90% by two weeks; the presence of antibodies in CSF, irrespective of prior vaccination, and in the serum of previously unvaccinated cases, is diagnostic of rabies
