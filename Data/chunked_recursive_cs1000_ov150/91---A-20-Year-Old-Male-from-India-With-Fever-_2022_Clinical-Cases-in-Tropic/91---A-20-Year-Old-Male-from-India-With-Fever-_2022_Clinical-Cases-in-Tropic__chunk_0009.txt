Rabies is a progressive, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus (Order Mononegavirales, Family Rhabdoviridae). Rabies lyssavirus (RABV), the prototype virus of the Lyssavirus genus, is the most common causative agent of rabies, usually transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, mostly dogs. About 61000 human global deaths occur because of rabies annually, mostly in Asia and Africa.
The incubation period is usually 20 to 90 days, but may vary. Two distinct clinical forms of rabies are recognized: Encephalitic ("furious") and paralytic ("dumb"). The encephalitic form rarely poses diagnostic difficulties because of the classical clinical features like hydrophobia, aerophobia, agitation and autonomic dysfunction; however, paralytic rabies may clinically mimic Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), post-vaccination encephalomyelitis and other conditions posing a challenge in diagnosis and management.
