Clinical mimics of rabies include several syndromes or diseases, such as Guillain Barré Syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and NMDAR antibody-mediated or Autoimmune encephalitis. Other mimics are Campylobacter-associated summer paralysis syndrome, cerebral malaria, herpes simplex encephalitis, and arthropod-borne encephalitides, for example Japanese encephalitis and West Nile Virus encephalitis. Poliomyelitis, B-virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1) encephalomyelitis, tetanus, snake- or scorpion-envenomation, organophosphate poisoning, illicit drug use or CNS intoxicants, and psychiatric disorders are also considered clinical mimics.
