Fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, quadriparesis with predominant involvement of proximal muscles, bowel and bladder involvement, percussion myoedema, presence of hydrophobia/aerophobia and CSF pleocytosis seen in paralytic rabies can help differentiate it from GBS. Post-vaccination complications historically observed with nerve tissue vaccines used in the past are rarely seen with the currently used rabies vaccines derived from tissue culture or embryonated eggs. High titres of neutralizing antibodies in CSF and serum and predominant involvement of grey matter in brain and spinal cord on neuroimaging in paralytic rabies can help distinguish it from post-vaccination neurological complications.

Nerve conduction studies (an axonal neuropathy supports rabies), neuroimaging and laboratory tests can aid in the diagnosis.
