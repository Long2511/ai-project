Nerve conduction studies (an axonal neuropathy supports rabies), neuroimaging and laboratory tests can aid in the diagnosis.

Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy of proven efficacy for rabies. Management consists of symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Prognosis is dismal in both forms of rabies, resulting in death within one to 2 weeks of symptom onset. Survival from rabies is extremely rare, though critical care can reportedly prolong survival by a few weeks or months in some cases.

This fatal disease can be prevented in most cases with appropriate PEP after exposure. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is recommended in individuals at high risk, including travellers to rabies-endemic countries.
