A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India is admitted to a local hospital with fever and quadriparesis.

He has had fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness initially in his left leg, subsequently involving all four limbs over the next 2 days. He gives a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb 1 month before onset of symptoms, for which he received five doses of anti-rabies vaccine (purified chick embryo cell vaccine), but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).

On admission, he is conscious and his mental functions are normal (GCS 15/15). His blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Neurological examination reveals a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis.
