A young male with a history of dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, presenting with fever and rapidly progressive ascending paresis a month later should elicit a high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies. Laboratory confirmation must be done wherever feasible to rule out clinical mimics amenable to treatment and to institute prompt infection control measures. Testing at least three saliva samples at 3- to 6-hour intervals (owing to intermittent shedding of the virus in saliva), along with a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR, can secure the diagnosis in most cases of the encephalitic form of rabies. Though serological diagnosis has a limited role in the first week of illness, detection of rabies-specific antibodies in serum (of an unvaccinated individual) or CSF can aid in diagnosis, especially in cases where survival is prolonged beyond a week
