In severe exposures (WHO category III) PEP consists of thorough wound washing, active vaccination with anti-rabies vaccines and passive vaccination with anti-rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). While it may take about 5 to 7 days for vaccine-induced antibodies to be produced, RIG, which is locally infiltrated into and around the wounds neutralizes the virus deposited at the site of the bite and prevents its entry into the nerves. Even though the patient received adequate doses of active vaccine, he did not receive RIG, which is life-saving in individuals with severe exposures. Administration of human or equine RIG (or recently available monoclonal antibodies) could have possibly prevented rabies in this case.
