Patients may present with symptoms of hypersplenism, such as abdominal discomfort and fatigue secondary to progressive anaemia. Ascites is uncommon because of the preserved hepatocellular function but may occur in advanced disease or in coexisting liver cirrhosis.

The classical clinical signs of liver cirrhosis (e.g. gynaeco-mastia, palmar erythema, alterations in distribution of body hair) are absent in schistosomiasis.

A common, primary presenting sign of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices. In some endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa half or more of upper GI bleeds are caused by portal hypertension.

The demonstration of Schistosoma eggs in the stool can be challenging in advanced disease because the adult flukes may have long died and egg production may have stopped.
