Other aetiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as pep-tic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis or a bleeding tumour are less likely and would not explain her splenomegaly. Notably though, in sub-Saharan Africa oesophageal cancer is strik-ingly common in young adults in their third and fourth decade of life. Risk factors remain poorly understood. Pro-gressive dysphagia rather than haematemesis is usually the presenting symptom.

Patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) can present with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. However, in VL there is usually a history of fever, and the patient's platelet count is only slightly diminished, which cannot explain her bleed. VL, furthermore, is uncommon in Southern Africa, even though few sporadic cases have been described from the region.

In a resource-constrained setting, very limited options may be available to establish more than just a syndromic diagnosis.
