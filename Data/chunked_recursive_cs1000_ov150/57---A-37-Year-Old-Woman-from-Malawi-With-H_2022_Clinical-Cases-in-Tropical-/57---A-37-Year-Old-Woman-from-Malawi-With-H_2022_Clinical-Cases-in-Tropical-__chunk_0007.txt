Other investigations to diagnose schistosomiasis will lack sensitivity and/or specificity in the endemic setting. The demonstration of Schistosoma eggs in the stool is challenging in advanced disease and several samples would have to be examined which is commonly not feasible. The circulating cathodic antigen test (CCA) is a urine rapid diagnostic test based on antigens regurgitated by adult flukes. Its sensitivity decreases when the worm burden is low, as may be the case in advanced disease; but it is highly specific and – other than serology – the CCA test is able to distinguish between active and past infection.

Hepatitis B or C serologies should be done; other inves-tigations for chronic liver disease are usually unavailable.
