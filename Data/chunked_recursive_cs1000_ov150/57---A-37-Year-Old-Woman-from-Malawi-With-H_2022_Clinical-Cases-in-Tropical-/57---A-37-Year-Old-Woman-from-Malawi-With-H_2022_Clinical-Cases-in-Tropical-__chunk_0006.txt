In a resource-constrained setting, very limited options may be available to establish more than just a syndromic diagnosis.

The patient should be taken for gastroduodenoscopy without delay to detect and treat the source of bleeding. In case of oesophageal varices, an experienced ultrasonogra-pher with a reasonable ultrasound machine would be able to distinguish between liver cirrhosis and periportal 'pipestem' fibrosis as seen in hepatic schistosomiasis (Fig. 57.1). Liver biopsy would be the most helpful tool to distinguish between cirrhosis and periportal fibrosis in case of schistosomiasis. It is usually unavailable, and it is risky in an environment where postinterventional monitoring is poor, and possible compli-cations such as intra-abdominal bleeds are likely to go undetected.
