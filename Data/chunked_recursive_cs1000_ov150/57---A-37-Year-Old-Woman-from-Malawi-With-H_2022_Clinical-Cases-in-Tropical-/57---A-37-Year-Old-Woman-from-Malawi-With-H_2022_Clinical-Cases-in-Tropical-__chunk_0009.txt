Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a complication of advanced infection with Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum or S. mekongi.

Only about 10% of people chronically infected with schisto-somiasis develop late-stage disease. Risk factors for disease progression remain poorly understood. Apart from intensity and duration of infection, host genetic factors such as ethnic background and IFN-gamma polymorphism, variable degrees of semi-immunity and parasite strain differences may play a role.

Chronic infection with liver-pathogenic Schistosoma species results in periportal fibrosis and portal venous hypertension. One exception is S. intercalatum, which occurs focally in Central and West Africa and causes granulomatous inflammation of the liver without portal hypertension.
