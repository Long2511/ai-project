A Malawian woman presents with a first episode of haema-temesis. She has neither taken NSAIDs nor alcohol. On examination she is afebrile, slightly pale, shocked and has an enlarged spleen. Her abdomen is non-tender. Her full blood count shows pancytopenia with normocytic anaemia.

Splenomegaly and pancytopenia point towards the presence of portal hypertension and she is most likely to bleed from gastro-oesophageal varices. In one series from Malawi, the presence of splenomegaly in patients with upper gastrointes-tinal bleeding was the single most specific clinical criterion to distinguish between a variceal bleed and a haemorrhage of other origin.
