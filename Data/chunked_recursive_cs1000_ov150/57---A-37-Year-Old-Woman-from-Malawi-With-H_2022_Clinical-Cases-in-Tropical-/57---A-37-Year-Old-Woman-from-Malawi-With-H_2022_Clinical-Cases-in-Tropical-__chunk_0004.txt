Furthermore, portal hypertension is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for more than 50% of bleeds in some series. The reason for this remains only partly under-stood. The prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse is not higher in the affected regions than elsewhere in the tropical world.

However, Malawi and other countries in the region are highly endemic for schistosomiasis. Virtually all water bodies in the country are infested with both Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium and it is likely that a high prevalence of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis with periportal fibrosis may explain why portal hypertension is so common in the region.

Little is known about causes of liver cirrhosis other than hepatitis B and C and their contribution to the burden of disease (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, haemochromatosis or Wil-son's disease).
