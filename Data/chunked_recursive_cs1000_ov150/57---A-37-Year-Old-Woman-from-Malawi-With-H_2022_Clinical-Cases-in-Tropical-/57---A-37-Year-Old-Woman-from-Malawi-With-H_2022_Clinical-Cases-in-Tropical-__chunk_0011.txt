Experienced ultrasonographers may be able to detect the typical pattern of 'pipestem fibrosis'. The term refers to the macroscopic aspect of the liver which shows wide bands of fibrosis around portal tracts resembling the stems of a clay pipe. If available, liver biopsy may show ova of Schistosoma species along with proliferation of fibrous tissue in and around the portal tract.

Praziquantel may have an effect in treatment of early fibrosis, but has little role to play in advanced disease. Nevertheless, a single dose treatment with praziquantel 40mg/kg may be given to stop the progression of fibrosis and reduce the worm burden and further egg production.

Treatment of variceal bleeding includes endoscopic sclerotherapy, band-ligation and devascularization surgery. Splenectomy is not recommended in tropical settings, because of the increased susceptibility to malaria and bacterial infections.
