Humans are thought usually to become infected by percutaneous inoculation through cuts and abrasions (e.g. when working in rice fields), inhalation/aspiration during severe weather events and ingestion (e.g. ingestion of contaminated and unchlorinated water supplies), although it is often difficult to determine precisely the mode of acquisition. Host factors are very important; the majority of cases occur in those who are immunocompromised, especially with diabetes mellitus, but also alcoholism, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, thalassaemia, steroid use, immunosuppressive therapy and cancer, but surprisingly not HIV infection. The disease is highly seasonal, with 80% of cases presenting during the wet season.
