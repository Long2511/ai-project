The patient was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and gentamicin while awaiting the culture results. Treatment was switched to ceftazidime after 48 hours when the laboratory alerted the clinicians to the suspicion of melioidosis. The patient improved after 7 days of treatment and was afebrile by day 14, when he was switched to oral co-trimoxazole to complete 20 weeks. Glycaemic control was established. No other foci of infection were detected by locally available investigations. The patient was discharged after 21 days of hospitalization and continued on oral ‘eradication' treatment for 5 months. He remains well.
