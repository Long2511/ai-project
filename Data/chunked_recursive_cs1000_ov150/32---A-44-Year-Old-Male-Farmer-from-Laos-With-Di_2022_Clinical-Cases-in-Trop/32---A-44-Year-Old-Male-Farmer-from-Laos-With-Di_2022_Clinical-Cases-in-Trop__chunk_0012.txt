. The confirmation of the diagnosis of melioidosis is based on the isolation and identification of B. pseudomallei in clinical samples, and in endemic areas it may be possible to reduce the time to diagnosis using immunofluorescence and lateral flow immunoassay on clinical specimens, and B. pseudomallei antigen latex agglutination on isolates. Serology has relatively low sensitivity and specificity with high rates of background seropositivity in those living in endemic regions. PCR assays on clinical specimens, aiming to provide a more rapid diagnosis, showed high specificity however the sensitivity on blood specimens depends on adequate bacterial concentration.
