Parenteral antibiotics (e.g. ceftazidime, meropenem) are usually given for 2 weeks in the acute phase, followed by oral co-trimoxazole to complete 3 to 6 months eradication therapy to minimize risk of relapse. For patients unable to take co-trimoxazole, co-amoxiclav is an alternative but has higher relapse rates. Supportive treatment of sepsis and surgical drainage of abscesses, as well as control of predisposing factors are also critical in optimizing outcome.
