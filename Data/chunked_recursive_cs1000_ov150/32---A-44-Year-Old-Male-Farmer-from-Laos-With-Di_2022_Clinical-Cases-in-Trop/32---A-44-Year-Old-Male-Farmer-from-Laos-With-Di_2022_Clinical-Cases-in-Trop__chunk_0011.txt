Clinical presentation varies from benign localized infection to rapidly progressive septicaemia. The bacteraemic form accounts for 40% to 60% of cases; and over half present with pneumonia, which carries a case fatality rate of 10% to 40%. The lethality is even higher in resource-poor settings where there is limited access to early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic treatment and intensive care facilities. The organism may localize in the lungs, liver, spleen, prostate, parotid, skin and soft tissue, bones and joints, or the central nervous system, causing abscesses and granulomas; but approximately 10% to 15% of bacteraemic cases have no evident clinical focus. It is important to use available imaging to identify the extent of infection and monitor the course of treatment. The confirmation of the diagnosis of melioidosis is based on the isolation and identification of B
