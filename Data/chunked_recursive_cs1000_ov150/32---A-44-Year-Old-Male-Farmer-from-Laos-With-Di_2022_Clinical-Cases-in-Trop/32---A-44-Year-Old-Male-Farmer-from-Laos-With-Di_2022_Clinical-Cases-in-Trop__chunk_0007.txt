Pus culture yielded B. pseudomallei after 48 hours, and later his blood culture also grew the same bacterium. Three throat swabs were cultured on selective media but failed to grow the organism. The CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 32.2). A shoulder radiograph showed no evidence of bony involvement. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly without evidence of liver or splenic abscesses.
