Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by B. pseudomallei, an environmental saprophyte endemic to South and South-east Asia and northern Australia. The disease is being described with increasing frequency both in non-endemic and in endemic areas. This may be because of a combination of greater awareness, improving laboratory facilities and research and possibly also as a result of a genuine increase in incidence. A modelling study has estimated 165,000 human melioidosis cases with 89,000 deaths per year worldwide making it a significant neglected tropical disease (NTD), even though it does not feature on the WHO's list of NTDs.
North-eastern Thailand and northern Australia are highly endemic areas, where B. pseudomallei is an important cause of community-acquired sepsis and pneumonia. It is probably widely distributed elsewhere outside the endemic region and may be greatly underdiagnosed.
