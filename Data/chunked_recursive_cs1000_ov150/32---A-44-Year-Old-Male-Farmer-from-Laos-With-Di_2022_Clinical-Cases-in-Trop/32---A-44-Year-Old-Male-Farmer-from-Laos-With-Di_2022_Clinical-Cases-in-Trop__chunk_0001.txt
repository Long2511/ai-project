A 44-year-old male rice farmer presents to a provincial hospital in Southern Laos in the rainy season with a 1-month history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia and a painful swelling over the left scapula. The swelling has gradually increased in size, without any history of preceding trauma. He has not noticed any lesions elsewhere. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 4 years previously but was not compliant with oral antidiabetic drugs or follow-up. The lesion on his back was incised and drained at a local health centre the previous week, since when he has been taking cloxacillin 1 g four times daily. However, there has been no improvement and during the 2 days prior to admission he has deteriorated, with high fever, chills and severe malaise.
