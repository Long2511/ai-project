Bacterial abscess with sepsis may be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or other Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus or anaerobes. This patient, however, has epidemiological and clinical risk factors for melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. This may cause a spectrum of disease in immunocompromised patients, especially diabetics, ranging from localized abscesses to pneumonia and septicaemia with disseminated abscess formation and high mortality. There is often no history of an inoculation injury or trauma.
Tuberculosis should also be considered with the sub-acute history of abscess with respiratory findings; however, tuberculous abscesses are usually 'cold', without much pain, erythema or warmth.
Disseminated fungal infection seems unlikely but would be possible if there was additional immunocompromise such as HIV.
