Essential investigations include blood culture and abscess swab (or deep pus) for microscopy and culture. A throat swab, or sputum sample if there is pulmonary involvement, may also be cultured on selective media, such as Ashdown's agar. A chest radiograph (CXR) should be done looking for evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. An ultrasound of the abdomen, or other imaging such as CT or MRI scan, should also be considered, because the findings of liver and splenic abscesses would strongly support a diagnosis of melioidosis while culture results are awaited. Biochemistry assays to check glucose and creatinine are important to optimize glycaemic control and adjust drug dosage respectively. Depending on the CXR findings, sputum, pleural fluid and pus may be sent for staining for acid-fast bacilli (e.g. Ziehl-Neelsen stain) and M. tuberculosis-PCR (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF).
