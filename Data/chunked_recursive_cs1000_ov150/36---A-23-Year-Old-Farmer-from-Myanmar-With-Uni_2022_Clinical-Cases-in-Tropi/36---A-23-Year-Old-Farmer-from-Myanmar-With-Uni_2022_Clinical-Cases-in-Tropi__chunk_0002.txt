The most common differentials to consider in a chronic, non-tender, unilateral scrotal swelling are inguinal hernia and hydrocoele. A testicular tumour also needs to be taken into consideration. Unlike hydrocoeles, hernias can often be manually reduced. Hydrocoeles may be verified by trans-illumination with a penlight.

The patient reports that scrotal swelling is common in the region where he comes from. This may suggest a possible infectious aetiology. The most important infectious disease to consider in this patient is lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. Hydrocoele is the most common clinical abnormality in men with bancroftian filariasis.
