Also, urogenital schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium) may lead to unilateral scrotal swelling, but it is not endemic in South-east Asia. Testicular tuberculosis is another infectious disease that may manifest with scrotal swelling. However, the long duration of the swelling in the absence of other signs and symptoms make this unlikely, and it would not explain the large number of cases seen in his home region.

Ultrasound can help distinguish a testicular tumour from a hydrocoele or hernia. Also, in case of lymphatic filariasis, adult worms may be seen on scrotal ultrasonography (“filarial dance sign”).
