The traditional diagnostic gold standard for lymphatic filariasis is the proof of microfilariae in the blood. Samples should be collected when microfilaraemia is highest. For the majority of filarial species, this is between 9 PM and 3 AM because of the nocturnal biting activities of most vectors. Microfilarial PCR assays have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to microscopy with an experienced microscopist, but are usually not available in a district hospital setting.
