Circulating filarial antigen (CFA) tests detect antigens released by adult W. bancrofti. They are available as immunochromatographic card tests and can use finger-prick blood. Because there is no periodicity of adult-worm antigens, CFA tests can be taken at any time. Their sensitivity and specificity are high. CFA tests are also the preferred method for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of bancroftian filariasis within national control programmes. Antifilarial antibody testing lacks specificity and is of limited value.

Hydrocoele was confirmed on ultrasound. The patient underwent hydrocoelectomy, and 3 litres of clear fluid could be drained during the operation. He also received antifilarial treatment. He lived in a remote area and was lost to follow-up afterwards.

The most advanced stage of chronic lymphoedema (stage III) is also referred to as 'elephantiasis'. Chronic ulceration with bacterial and fungal superinfection is a common problem.
