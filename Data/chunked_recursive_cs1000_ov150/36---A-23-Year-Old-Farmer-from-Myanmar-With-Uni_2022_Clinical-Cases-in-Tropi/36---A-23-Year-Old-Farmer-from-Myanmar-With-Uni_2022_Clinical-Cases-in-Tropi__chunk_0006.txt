Moreover, in areas of high HIV prevalence, lymphatic filariasis was found to increase susceptibility to HIV infection by inducing systemic CD4 T-cell activation.

Drugs used for treatment and control of lymphatic filariasis include diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, albendazole and doxycycline. In terms of their effects on W. bancrofti and Brugia species, Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has some effect in eliminating microfilariae and is most effective at eliminating adult worms. Ivermectin is most effective at eliminating microfilariae while having some effect on adult worms. Albendazole has no effect on microfilariae but eliminates some adult worms. Doxycycline also has no effect on microfilariae and is most effective at eliminating adult worms. Albendazole 400mg STAT with either DEC (6mg/kg) or ivermectin (200 µg/kg) reduces microfilaraemia to very low levels. A triple therapy combining all three drugs appears even more efficacious.
