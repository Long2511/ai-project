For management of lymphoedema, meticulous hygiene is crucial, such as daily washing with water and soap and careful drying of the affected limb. Bacterial and fungal infections should be treated early. Specialized shoes should be worn to prevent injury if the lower limbs are affected. Integration of lymphoedema care and leprosy or diabetic foot care programmes are being promoted.

Small hydrocoeles sometimes regress after anthelmintic treatment. Large hydrocoeles require surgery.
