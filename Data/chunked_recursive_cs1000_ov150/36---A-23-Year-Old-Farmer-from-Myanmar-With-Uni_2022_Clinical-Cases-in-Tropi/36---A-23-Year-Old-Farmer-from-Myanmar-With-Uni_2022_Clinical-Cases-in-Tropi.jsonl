The swelling is non-tender and has gradually increased in size. There is no history of fever. He has attempted to treat the swelling with traditional herbal medicine to no avail.\n\nThe patient comes from the central part of Myanmar. He reports that scrotal swelling is not an uncommon problem in his home region.\n\nThe patient is a 23-year-old man in fair general condition. His vital signs are normal and he is afebrile. There is unilateral scrotal swelling, which cannot be reduced. There are no palpable inguinal lymph nodes.\n\nA young Burmese farmer presents with progressive unilateral scrotal swelling. On examination, the swelling is non-tender and non-reducible. He does not have any other symptoms or signs."}

A testicular tumour also needs to be taken into consideration. Unlike hydrocoeles, hernias can often be manually reduced. Hydrocoeles may be verified by trans-illumination with a penlight.\n\nThe patient reports that scrotal swelling is common in the region where he comes from. This may suggest a possible infectious aetiology. The most important infectious disease to consider in this patient is lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. Hydrocoele is the most common clinical abnormality in men with bancroftian filariasis."}

Testicular tuberculosis is another infectious disease that may manifest with scrotal swelling. However, the long duration of the swelling in the absence of other signs and symptoms make this unlikely, and it would not explain the large number of cases seen in his home region.\n\nUltrasound can help distinguish a testicular tumour from a hydrocoele or hernia. Also, in case of lymphatic filariasis, adult worms may be seen on scrotal ultrasonography (“filarial dance sign”)."}

Samples should be collected when microfilaraemia is highest. For the majority of filarial species, this is between 9 PM and 3 AM because of the nocturnal biting activities of most vectors. Microfilarial PCR assays have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to microscopy with an experienced microscopist, but are usually not available in a district hospital setting."}

They are available as immunochromatographic card tests and can use finger-prick blood. Because there is no periodicity of adult-worm antigens, CFA tests can be taken at any time. Their sensitivity and specificity are high. CFA tests are also the preferred method for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of bancroftian filariasis within national control programmes. Antifilarial antibody testing lacks specificity and is of limited value.\n\nHydrocoele was confirmed on ultrasound. The patient underwent hydrocoelectomy, and 3 litres of clear fluid could be drained during the operation. He also received antifilarial treatment. He lived in a remote area and was lost to follow-up afterwards.\n\nThe most advanced stage of chronic lymphoedema (stage III) is also referred to as 'elephantiasis'. Chronic ulceration with bacterial and fungal superinfection is a common problem."}

In terms of their effects on W. bancrofti and Brugia species, Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has some effect in eliminating microfilariae and is most effective at eliminating adult worms. Ivermectin is most effective at eliminating microfilariae while having some effect on adult worms. Albendazole has no effect on microfilariae but eliminates some adult worms. Doxycycline also has no effect on microfilariae and is most effective at eliminating adult worms. Albendazole 400mg STAT with either DEC (6mg/kg) or ivermectin (200 µg/kg) reduces microfilaraemia to very low levels. A triple therapy combining all three drugs appears even more efficacious."}

Several weeks of treatment are required, and doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy and in children under the age of 8 years, which make it an unsuitable option for mass treatment. Its role may be in individual treatment of LF patients who lack any of the contraindications."}

Bacterial and fungal infections should be treated early. Specialized shoes should be worn to prevent injury if the lower limbs are affected. Integration of lymphoedema care and leprosy or diabetic foot care programmes are being promoted.\n\nSmall hydrocoeles sometimes regress after anthelmintic treatment. Large hydrocoeles require surgery."}
