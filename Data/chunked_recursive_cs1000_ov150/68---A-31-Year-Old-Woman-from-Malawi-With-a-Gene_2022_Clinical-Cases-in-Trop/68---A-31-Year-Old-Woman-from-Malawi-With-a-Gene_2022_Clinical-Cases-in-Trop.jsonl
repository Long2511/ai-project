The rash started 3 days before on the trunk, and then spread to the extremities and the mucosal membranes involving lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae and genital mucosa.\n\nThere is also a productive cough with whitish sputum that started 1 day before the rash appeared, and she also reports a sore throat and dysuria for the past 2 days.\n\nThe patient had been found to be HIV positive 2 months earlier, when she was hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis. She was treated with high-dose oral fluconazole, because amphotericin B and flucytosine were unavailable. She improved and was discharged home on a maintenance dose of fluconazole. Antiretroviral treatment with stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP), as well as co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, were started 1 month previously.\n\nThe rest of the medical history is unremarkable and there are no known allergies."}

There is a generalized, non-itchy maculopapular rash involving the skin and mucous membranes but sparing the palms and soles. There is bilateral conjunctivitis. The eyelids and lips are covered with haemorrhagic crusts (Fig. 68.1). The lips are swollen and she can hardly open her mouth; talking and eating are difficult and painful. The chest is clear.\n\nA young Malawian woman presents with a generalized rash involving her skin and mucous membranes. She also complains of a productive cough of short duration, dysuria and dysphagia.\n\nThe patient is HIV positive. Within the past month she commenced treatment with co-trimoxazole and an antiretroviral triple therapy with d4T, 3TC and NVP. She has a low-grade fever, but her chest is clear."}

This potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction is most commonly caused by drugs. Its incidence is much higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. If SJS involves more than 30% of the skin surface, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). SJS/TEN may lead to widespread epidermal detachment and erosions of the mucous membranes. Non-specific prodromal symptoms such as cough, sore throat, fever, headache and myalgias usually precede the rash by several days and may be mistaken for a bacterial or viral infection, or for malaria in a tropical setting."}

Once suspected, all potentially causative drugs should be immediately withdrawn. If in doubt, all drugs need to be stopped. In general, medications initiated 2 to 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms are usually responsible. In this patient's case, the major culprit drugs were nevirapine and co-trimoxazole."}

However, patients with SJS/TEN often develop large bullous skin lesions. Once they break open, this leads to considerable loss of serous fluid, similar to a burn. Therefore, patients with SJS/TEN ideally should be managed in a burns unit. Topical antiseptics will reduce skin colonization; however, wound debridement is not recommended. Steroid eye drops should be given in case of conjunctivitis, and early ophthalmological review should be sought to prevent conjunctival scarring and blindness. Patients need careful management of fluids and electrolytes and high caloric nutrition. A nasogastric (NG) tube is often helpful until the mucosal lesions have healed. Fever may be part of the clinical picture and there is no role for prophylactic antibiotics unless there are signs of sepsis. Vital signs need to be checked regularly, and blood cultures and full blood count taken repeatedly."}

Skin and mucosal lesions in SJS/TEN are very painful. Often, opioids are necessary to control the pain.\n\nUpon discharge, patients should be urged to avoid the culprit drug and this should be clearly stated in the patient's documents.\n\nAntiretroviral drugs and co-trimoxazole were stopped on admission. Because the patient was febrile, blood cultures and a rapid malaria test were taken and both came back negative. She received IV fluids and a urinary catheter. The patient and her family declined an NG tube, because they had observed that patients who had an NG tube or oxygen probes were more likely to die than patients who did not have such devices.\n\nThe patient was given 0.9% normal saline as mouthwash and dexamethasone eye ointment. Fever and cough settled spontaneously. She was discharged after 10 days in hospital."}

Co-trimoxazole was not replaced because there were no alternative drugs available. The new drug combination was tolerated well and no further rash occurred.\n\nSJS is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SJS, less than 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30% is affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Between 10% and 30% it is classified as 'SJS/TEN overlap'. The extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for prognosis.\n\nIn Western industrialized countries, SJS/TEN is considered rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year. However, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive individuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and other high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this condition."}

Host genetic factors also seem to play a role.\n\nThe pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of an unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis."}

After several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more and more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to flaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis (Fig. 68.2), which causes intense pain. Conjunctivitis is common and may lead to scarring and blindness. Involvement of the oral mucosa and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips make it difficult for the patient to eat, drink and talk. Involvement of the urogenital mucosa is very painful and may lead to urethral strictures. The oesophagus and trachea may also be affected.\n\nDiagnosis can often be made clinically. Skin biopsies may help rule out the major differential diagnoses such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus."}

Treatment is supportive and there is no clear benefit of any other disease-modifying interventions. Systemic corticosteroids do not seem helpful and the use of IV immunoglobulins is disputed. However, data from large controlled clinical trials are lacking.\n\nAccording to literature from the developed world, the case fatality rate of patients with SJS is up to 5%; in TEN it is 30% on average. Primary causes of death are infection and multi-organ failure.\n\nA severity-of-illness score (SCORTEN) has been published to predict the lethality of patients with SJS/TEN. Its use in resource-constrained setting is limited, because it requires laboratory results (urea, bicarbonate, glucose) that may be difficult to obtain."}
