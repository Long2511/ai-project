The most important diagnosis to consider is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis. This potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction is most commonly caused by drugs. Its incidence is much higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. If SJS involves more than 30% of the skin surface, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). SJS/TEN may lead to widespread epidermal detachment and erosions of the mucous membranes. Non-specific prodromal symptoms such as cough, sore throat, fever, headache and myalgias usually precede the rash by several days and may be mistaken for a bacterial or viral infection, or for malaria in a tropical setting.
