SJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms. After several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more and more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to flaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis (Fig. 68.2), which causes intense pain. Conjunctivitis is common and may lead to scarring and blindness. Involvement of the oral mucosa and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips make it difficult for the patient to eat, drink and talk. Involvement of the urogenital mucosa is very painful and may lead to urethral strictures. The oesophagus and trachea may also be affected.

Diagnosis can often be made clinically. Skin biopsies may help rule out the major differential diagnoses such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus.
