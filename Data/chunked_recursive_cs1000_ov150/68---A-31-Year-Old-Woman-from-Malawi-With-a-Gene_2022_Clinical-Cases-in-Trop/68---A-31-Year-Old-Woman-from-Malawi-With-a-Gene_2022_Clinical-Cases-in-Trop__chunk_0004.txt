SJS/TEN is a clinical diagnosis. Once suspected, all potentially causative drugs should be immediately withdrawn. If in doubt, all drugs need to be stopped. In general, medications initiated 2 to 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms are usually responsible. In this patient's case, the major culprit drugs were nevirapine and co-trimoxazole.
