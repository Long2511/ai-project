The drugs most commonly implicated in SJS/TEN are antibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes), the antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol.

Infectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV) may also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play a role.

The pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of an unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis.
