A urinary catheter should be inserted to prevent urethral strictures. Skin and mucosal lesions in SJS/TEN are very painful. Often, opioids are necessary to control the pain.

Upon discharge, patients should be urged to avoid the culprit drug and this should be clearly stated in the patient's documents.

Antiretroviral drugs and co-trimoxazole were stopped on admission. Because the patient was febrile, blood cultures and a rapid malaria test were taken and both came back negative. She received IV fluids and a urinary catheter. The patient and her family declined an NG tube, because they had observed that patients who had an NG tube or oxygen probes were more likely to die than patients who did not have such devices.

The patient was given 0.9% normal saline as mouthwash and dexamethasone eye ointment. Fever and cough settled spontaneously. She was discharged after 10 days in hospital.
