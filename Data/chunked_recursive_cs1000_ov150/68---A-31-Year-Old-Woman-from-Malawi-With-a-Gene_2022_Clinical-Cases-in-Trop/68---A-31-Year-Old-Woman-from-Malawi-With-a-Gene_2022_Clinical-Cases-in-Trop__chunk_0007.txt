When all lesions had completely healed, she was started on a new antiretroviral combination therapy and nevirapine was replaced by efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole was not replaced because there were no alternative drugs available. The new drug combination was tolerated well and no further rash occurred.

SJS is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SJS, less than 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30% is affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Between 10% and 30% it is classified as 'SJS/TEN overlap'. The extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for prognosis.

In Western industrialized countries, SJS/TEN is considered rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year. However, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive individuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and other high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this condition.
