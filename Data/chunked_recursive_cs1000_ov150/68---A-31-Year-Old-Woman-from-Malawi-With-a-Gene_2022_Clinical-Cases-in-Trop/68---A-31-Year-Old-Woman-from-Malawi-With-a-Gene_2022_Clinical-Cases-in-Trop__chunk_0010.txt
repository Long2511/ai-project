All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately. Treatment is supportive and there is no clear benefit of any other disease-modifying interventions. Systemic corticosteroids do not seem helpful and the use of IV immunoglobulins is disputed. However, data from large controlled clinical trials are lacking.

According to literature from the developed world, the case fatality rate of patients with SJS is up to 5%; in TEN it is 30% on average. Primary causes of death are infection and multi-organ failure.

A severity-of-illness score (SCORTEN) has been published to predict the lethality of patients with SJS/TEN. Its use in resource-constrained setting is limited, because it requires laboratory results (urea, bicarbonate, glucose) that may be difficult to obtain.
