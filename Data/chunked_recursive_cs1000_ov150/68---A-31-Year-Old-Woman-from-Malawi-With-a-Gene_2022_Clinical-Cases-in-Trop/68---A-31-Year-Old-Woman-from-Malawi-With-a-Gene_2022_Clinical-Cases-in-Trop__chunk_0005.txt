The patient at this stage only had a maculopapular rash. However, patients with SJS/TEN often develop large bullous skin lesions. Once they break open, this leads to considerable loss of serous fluid, similar to a burn. Therefore, patients with SJS/TEN ideally should be managed in a burns unit. Topical antiseptics will reduce skin colonization; however, wound debridement is not recommended. Steroid eye drops should be given in case of conjunctivitis, and early ophthalmological review should be sought to prevent conjunctival scarring and blindness. Patients need careful management of fluids and electrolytes and high caloric nutrition. A nasogastric (NG) tube is often helpful until the mucosal lesions have healed. Fever may be part of the clinical picture and there is no role for prophylactic antibiotics unless there are signs of sepsis. Vital signs need to be checked regularly, and blood cultures and full blood count taken repeatedly.
