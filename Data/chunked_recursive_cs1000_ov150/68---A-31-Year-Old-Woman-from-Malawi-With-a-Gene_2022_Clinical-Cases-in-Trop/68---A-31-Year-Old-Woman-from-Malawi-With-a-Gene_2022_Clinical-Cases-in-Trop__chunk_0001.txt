A 31-year-old woman presents to a hospital in Malawi with a generalized skin rash. The rash started 3 days before on the trunk, and then spread to the extremities and the mucosal membranes involving lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae and genital mucosa.

There is also a productive cough with whitish sputum that started 1 day before the rash appeared, and she also reports a sore throat and dysuria for the past 2 days.

The patient had been found to be HIV positive 2 months earlier, when she was hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis. She was treated with high-dose oral fluconazole, because amphotericin B and flucytosine were unavailable. She improved and was discharged home on a maintenance dose of fluconazole. Antiretroviral treatment with stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP), as well as co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, were started 1 month previously.

The rest of the medical history is unremarkable and there are no known allergies.
