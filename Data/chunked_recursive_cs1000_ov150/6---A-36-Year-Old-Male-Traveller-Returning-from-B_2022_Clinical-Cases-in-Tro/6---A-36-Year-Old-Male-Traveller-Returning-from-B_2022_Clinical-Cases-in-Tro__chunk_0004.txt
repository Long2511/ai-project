A very rare cause of migratory swellings and eosinophilia is sparganosis. It is caused by larvae (‘spargana') of canine and feline tapeworms of the genus Spirometra and acquired by drinking water containing infected copepods or by eating raw or undercooked intermediate hosts such as amphibians or reptiles. It mainly occurs in East and South-East Asia, but cases have also been reported in East Africa.

Several other infections acquired in the tropics can be migratory and are associated with an itchy track-like rash. Such creeping eruptions are commonly caused by larvae of animal hookworms or Strongyloides stercoralis but these present with fine, serpiginous tracks and not with a large mobile mass, as seen in this patient. Very rare causes of creeping eruption are ectopic fascioliasis and migratory myiasis.

Deaths from gnathostomiasis have occurred when the parasite has entered the brain or spinal cord, causing severe neurological sequelae.
