Deaths from gnathostomiasis have occurred when the parasite has entered the brain or spinal cord, causing severe neurological sequelae.

The patient admitted that on their trip they had made sushi from fresh fish caught in the river. A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous gnathostomiasis was made and the patient was started on albendazole 400 mg bid for 21 days and ivermectin 200 µg/kg stat. Serology for Gnathostoma was negative. Over the next 6 days, the serpiginous lesion migrated over his shoulder and neck, disappeared for 24 hours, then reappeared between his eyebrows, moved to his forehead and face, and then was felt inside his nose. On the sixth day of treatment he expressed a larva from his nostril, which was identified as Gnathostoma spinigerum. His two friends were also seen at the same institution and were given similar treatment with full resolution of their symptoms.
