Larvae penetrate the human intestinal wall and wander around the body. Initial symptoms are non-specific and may include fever, malaise, vomiting and diarrhoea lasting for 2 to 3 weeks. This is accompanied by marked eosinophilia. Within 1 month cutaneous infection may develop, manifesting as non-pitting oedematous migratory swellings that may be pruritic or painful and mainly affect the trunk and the proximal limbs. Visceral disease occurs when the larvae migrate through the internal organs such as the lungs, gut, genitourinary tract, eye and CNS. CNS invasion may manifest as eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid haemorrhages, cranial neuritis or painful radiculomyelitis as a result of invasion of the spinal cord. Diagnosis is suggested by eosinophilia, migratory swellings and a history of geographical and food exposure
