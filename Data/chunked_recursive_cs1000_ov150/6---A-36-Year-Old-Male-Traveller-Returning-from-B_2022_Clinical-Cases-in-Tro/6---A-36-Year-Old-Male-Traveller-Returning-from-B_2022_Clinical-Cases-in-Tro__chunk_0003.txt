This patient is systemically well, with a mobile itchy mass. The eosinophilia suggests a parasitic cause. The fact that two of his travel companions are experiencing similar symptoms indicates a common exposure factor.

The presentation is classic for gnathostomiasis, even though his travel history appears uncommon. Gnathostomiasis is endemic in South-East Asia and Latin America, but only a few cases have been reported in Africa. It is a food-borne zoonotic nematode infection that classically presents with a mobile subcutaneous mass, intermittent creeping eruptions and eosinophilia. The infection is acquired by eating raw fish and other food items.

Intermittent migratory swellings are also typically seen in patients with Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), but Loa loa is not endemic in the Okavango Delta and the minimum incubation time is 5 months.
