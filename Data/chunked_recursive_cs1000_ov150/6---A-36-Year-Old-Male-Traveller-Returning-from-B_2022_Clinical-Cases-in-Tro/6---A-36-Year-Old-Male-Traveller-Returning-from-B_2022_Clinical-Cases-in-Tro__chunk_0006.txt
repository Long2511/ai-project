Gnathostomiasis is mostly caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, a zoonotic nematode. Humans are accidental hosts. Gnathostomiasis is endemic throughout areas where large amounts of raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans are consumed, most importantly in East and South-East Asia and Central and South America. Case reports are emerging from Southern Africa.

Adult worms infect the gastrointestinal tract of feline and canine species. When eggs excreted through the faeces get into water, first-stage larvae hatch, which then infect small freshwater crustaceans. A large variety of animals can act as a second intermediate host. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked meat of intermediate hosts, such as freshwater fish, crabs, shrimps, frogs, snakes, fowl and pork. Gnathostomiasis commonly occurs in outbreaks.
