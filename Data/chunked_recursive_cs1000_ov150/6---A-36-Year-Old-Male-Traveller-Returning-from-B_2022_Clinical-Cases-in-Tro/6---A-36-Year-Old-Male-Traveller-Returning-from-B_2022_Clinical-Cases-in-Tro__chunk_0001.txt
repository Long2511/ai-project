A 36-year-old male restaurant owner presents to a travel clinic in Europe with a mobile itchy mass under his skin. Three weeks ago, he noted the mass in his groin for 4 days after which it subsided. He then noted an itchy, serpiginous rash tracking from his groin to his chest, which moved over the course of several days and then disappeared; he then noted the mass reappearing on his right shoulder, at which point he was referred for assessment. There is no history of fever or systemic illness.

Five weeks ago, he returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. He took malaria chemoprophylaxis, slept on the boat under a mosquito net and swam in fresh river water. He ate freshwater fish from the river.

He is married and denies sexual contact on the trip. Of the four friends who accompanied him, two also have the same complaint.
