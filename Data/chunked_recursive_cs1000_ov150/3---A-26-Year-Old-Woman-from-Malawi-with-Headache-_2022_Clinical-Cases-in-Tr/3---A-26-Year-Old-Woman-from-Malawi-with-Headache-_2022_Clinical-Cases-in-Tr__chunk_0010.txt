TB-meningitis is an emergency. Treatment should be started without delay once the diagnosis is considered. The WHO recommends treatment with the same regimen as any form of tuberculosis starting with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Usually, treatment is for 9 to 12 months. Corticosteroids seem to improve clinical outcomes and are currently recommended; however, their effects may vary in different clinical settings.
