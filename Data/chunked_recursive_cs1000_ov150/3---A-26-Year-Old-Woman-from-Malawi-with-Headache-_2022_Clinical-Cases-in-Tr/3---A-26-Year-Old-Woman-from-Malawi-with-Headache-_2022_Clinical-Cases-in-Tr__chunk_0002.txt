Her blood results showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 ×10^9/L and hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, both below their respective reference ranges of 4-10 and 12-14. The platelet count was 155 ×10^9/L, within the reference range of 150-350, and serum glucose was 4.0 mmol/L, within the reference range of 3.9-11.1. A thick film for malaria and trypanosomes was negative. A lumbar puncture is done. The opening pressure is markedly raised, at 32 cmH2O (12–20 cmH2O). The available CSF results showed a white cell count of 54 per microliter, which is higher than the reference of 0-5. CSF protein was elevated at 3.0 g/L, compared to a reference of 0.25-0.55, and CSF glucose was low at 1.3 mmol/L, compared to a reference range of 2.0-2.64, which is one-half to two-thirds of the paired serum glucose sample.

A young Malawian widow presents with headache and confusion. She is febrile and has a unilateral third nerve palsy. The CSF examination reveals an inflammatory picture with low glucose.
