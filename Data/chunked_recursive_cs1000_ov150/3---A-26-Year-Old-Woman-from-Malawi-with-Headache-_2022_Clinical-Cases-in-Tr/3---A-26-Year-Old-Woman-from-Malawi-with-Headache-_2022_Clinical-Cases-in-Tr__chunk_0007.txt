The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2g bid, fluconazole 1200 mg od (local protocol for cryptococcal meningitis in the absence of amphotericin B and flucytosin) and on treatment for presumptive TB-meningitis.

The HIV test came back reactive. India Ink stain, cryptococcal and bacterial culture were reported negative, but acidfast bacilli were detected in the CSF (Fig. 3.2).

The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established. A few days into treatment the patient slipped into a coma. An MRI scan of her brain revealed bilateral basal ganglia infarctions. She died in the hospital.

Tuberculous (TB) meningitis is the most dramatic form of tuberculosis. After the release of bacilli and granulomatous material into the subarachnoid space, a florid gelatinous exudate forms, which may impair CSF circulation and cause hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies and vasculitis. Vasculitis is the most serious complication of tuberculous meningitis and may lead to cerebrovascular accidents.
