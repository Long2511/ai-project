She has been unwell for at least 1 week. She complained of a headache of insidious onset and has been confused for 2 days. One day before presentation the relatives ('guardians') noticed an eyelid drooping on the left side.\n\nThe guardians say her past medical history is unremarkable. The patient lives in an urban high-density area. She works as a businesswoman, selling vegetables. She has three healthy children, but another four of her children have died as toddlers. Her husband died a year ago of 'high fever.'\n\nOn examination she looks seriously unwell. Glasgow Coma Scale 14/15, temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 86bpm, respiratory rate 18 breath cycles per minute. There is no neck stiffness. The chest is clear. Figure 3.1 shows the examination of her eyes. The remainder of her neurological examination is normal."}

The platelet count was 155 ×10^9/L, within the reference range of 150-350, and serum glucose was 4.0 mmol/L, within the reference range of 3.9-11.1. A thick film for malaria and trypanosomes was negative. A lumbar puncture is done. The opening pressure is markedly raised, at 32 cmH2O (12–20 cmH2O). The available CSF results showed a white cell count of 54 per microliter, which is higher than the reference of 0-5. CSF protein was elevated at 3.0 g/L, compared to a reference of 0.25-0.55, and CSF glucose was low at 1.3 mmol/L, compared to a reference range of 2.0-2.64, which is one-half to two-thirds of the paired serum glucose sample.\n\nA young Malawian widow presents with headache and confusion. She is febrile and has a unilateral third nerve palsy. The CSF examination reveals an inflammatory picture with low glucose."}

Infectious encephalitis should also be considered; however, the cranial nerve involvement makes this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, the main causes of infectious encephalitis are viral or - less commonly – protozoan (e.g. cerebral toxoplasmosis, human African trypanosomiasis), and the CSF findings of very high protein and very low glucose are not consistent with a viral or protozoan CNS infection. Cerebral malaria has to be considered in any patient with fever and impaired consciousness living in a malarious area. However, cerebral malaria would be an uncommonly severe manifestation in a most probably semi-immune adult residing in a holoendemic area. In addition, cranial nerve palsies are an unusual feature of cerebral malaria."}

A comparison of these types shows that acute bacterial meningitis, caused by pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, has a rapid onset with high fever, and its CSF is often cloudy with a high leukocyte count and low glucose. In contrast, tuberculous meningitis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has a less abrupt onset over several days with common cranial nerve involvement, and its CSF is often clear with high protein and low glucose. Cryptococcal meningitis, from Cryptococcus neoformans, has a subacute onset with severe headache and common cranial nerve involvement; its CSF can be normal in at least a quarter of cases. Neither the patient's clinical presentation nor her CSF results can help differentiate reliably between the three"}

Immediate action should be taken, and treatment should not be delayed whilst further test results are being awaited. Pragmatic treatment should cover bacterial, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis.\n\nGram-stain and bacterial culture should be done from the CSF. If available, an ultrasensitive PCR for M. tuberculosis (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) should be ordered. The sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen stain from the CSF is low in many settings. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAG) testing should be done from CSF and serum; additionally, India ink stain and fungal culture should be done for detection of Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\nAn HIV-serology study is crucial because cryptococcal meningitis is associated with immunosuppression. Tuberculous meningitis is also more common in HIV-positive than in uninfected persons."}

India Ink stain, cryptococcal and bacterial culture were reported negative, but acidfast bacilli were detected in the CSF (Fig. 3.2).\n\nThe diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established. A few days into treatment the patient slipped into a coma. An MRI scan of her brain revealed bilateral basal ganglia infarctions. She died in the hospital.\n\nTuberculous (TB) meningitis is the most dramatic form of tuberculosis. After the release of bacilli and granulomatous material into the subarachnoid space, a florid gelatinous exudate forms, which may impair CSF circulation and cause hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies and vasculitis. Vasculitis is the most serious complication of tuberculous meningitis and may lead to cerebrovascular accidents."}

It is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion in settings with high TB prevalence. The clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is guided by four pillars. The clinical criteria include a symptom duration of over five days; systemic symptoms such as weight loss or night sweats; a history of TB contact; and neurological signs like cranial nerve palsy or altered consciousness. The CSF criteria include a clear appearance; a leukocyte count between 10 and 500 per microliter with a lymphocytic predominance; a protein concentration over 1 g/L; and a low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Neuroimaging criteria can include hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculoma, or infarct"}

Neuroimaging criteria can include hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculoma, or infarct. Finally, evidence of TB elsewhere in the body can be established through chest radiography, other imaging, or positive laboratory tests from extraneural specimens. The WHO now recommends the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra as the initial diagnostic test for suspected tuberculous meningitis. The Xpert is a cartridge-based fully automated PCR test that can easily be used, even in resource-limited settings."}

Treatment should be started without delay once the diagnosis is considered. The WHO recommends treatment with the same regimen as any form of tuberculosis starting with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Usually, treatment is for 9 to 12 months. Corticosteroids seem to improve clinical outcomes and are currently recommended; however, their effects may vary in different clinical settings."}
