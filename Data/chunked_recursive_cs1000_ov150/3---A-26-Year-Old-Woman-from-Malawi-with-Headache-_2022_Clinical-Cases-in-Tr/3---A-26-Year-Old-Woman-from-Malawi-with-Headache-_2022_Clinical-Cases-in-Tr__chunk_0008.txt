A definitive diagnosis of TB-meningitis is established when acid-fast bacilli are seen in the CSF or detected by a reliable molecular method such as PCR, or if Mycobacterium tuberculosis is cultured from the CSF. It is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion in settings with high TB prevalence. The clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is guided by four pillars. The clinical criteria include a symptom duration of over five days; systemic symptoms such as weight loss or night sweats; a history of TB contact; and neurological signs like cranial nerve palsy or altered consciousness. The CSF criteria include a clear appearance; a leukocyte count between 10 and 500 per microliter with a lymphocytic predominance; a protein concentration over 1 g/L; and a low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Neuroimaging criteria can include hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculoma, or infarct
