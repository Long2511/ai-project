The differential diagnosis comprises bacterial, tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. A comparison of these types shows that acute bacterial meningitis, caused by pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, has a rapid onset with high fever, and its CSF is often cloudy with a high leukocyte count and low glucose. In contrast, tuberculous meningitis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has a less abrupt onset over several days with common cranial nerve involvement, and its CSF is often clear with high protein and low glucose. Cryptococcal meningitis, from Cryptococcus neoformans, has a subacute onset with severe headache and common cranial nerve involvement; its CSF can be normal in at least a quarter of cases. Neither the patient's clinical presentation nor her CSF results can help differentiate reliably between the three
