Cerebral malaria is defined as an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. Malaria kills almost 450000 people per year, the vast majority of them children younger than 6 years old living in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these children have cerebral malaria (Fig. 4.2).
