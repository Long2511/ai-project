People living in an area of high malaria transmission (such as rural Uganda in the rainy season) may be frequently bitten by malaria-infected female anopheline mosquitoes. Initially, this produces clinical illness (either uncomplicated or complicated malaria); but with repeated infectious challenges, a state of asymptomatic parasitaemia may be attained. Therefore in African children in a coma, a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out an underlying non-malarial aetiology of acute illness. In parasitaemic African children in a coma, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy may be useful in differentiating malarial from non-malarial aetiologies of coma (see Summary Box).
