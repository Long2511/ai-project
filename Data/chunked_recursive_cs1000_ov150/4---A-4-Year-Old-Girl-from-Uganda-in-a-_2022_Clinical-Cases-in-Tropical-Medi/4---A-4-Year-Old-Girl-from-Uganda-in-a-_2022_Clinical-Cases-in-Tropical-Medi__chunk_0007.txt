Although the child has a positive malaria RDT, a lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out bacterial meningitis. If available, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be useful to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus as either a primary coma aetiology or a contributor to illness. More sophisticated laboratory evaluations (creatinine, electrolytes, bilirubin) may be useful but are seldom available in the geographical contexts where malaria is most prevalent.
