It is the rainy season in rural eastern Uganda. A 4-year-old girl, previously healthy, is carried into the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department. Her father reports that she was well until yesterday. She had a bad headache in the early afternoon but later in the evening developed shaking chills. Believing this was yet another episode of malaria, a common problem in their village, the family planned to take her to the health centre in the morning. The child slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. today the family woke to find the girl was in the midst of a seizure, which lasted about ten minutes. It has taken 4 hours for the family to reach A&E and the little girl has not awoken. The child has not had any recent head trauma and the family knows of no other reason that the child might be ill.
