A lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF was clear and acellular; opening pressure was normal. Blood cultures were taken, and mydriatic drops instilled to perform ophthalmoscopy. This revealed white-centred haemorrhages in both eyes. A diagnosis of retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria was made.
After administration of artesunate 2.4 mg/kg IV in A&E, the child was admitted to the high-dependency section of the hospital's paediatric unit for frequent monitoring of vital signs and serum glucose. Artesunate was repeated at 12 and 24 hours and then once daily. An EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Twelve hours after admission the child had one short (1 minute) generalized seizure that spontaneously resolved and did not recur. Forty hours after admission her Blantyre Coma Score was 4/5. The child was discharged home on hospital day five, with a follow-up appointment in the neurology clinic scheduled after 4 weeks.
