A 4-year-old girl, previously healthy, is carried into the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department. Her father reports that she was well until yesterday. She had a bad headache in the early afternoon but later in the evening developed shaking chills. Believing this was yet another episode of malaria, a common problem in their village, the family planned to take her to the health centre in the morning. The child slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. today the family woke to find the girl was in the midst of a seizure, which lasted about ten minutes. It has taken 4 hours for the family to reach A&E and the little girl has not awoken. The child has not had any recent head trauma and the family knows of no other reason that the child might be ill."}

She has no neck stiffness or jaundice. Capillary refill is normal. There is nasal flaring with respirations. Blantyre Coma Scale is 1/5. Pupils are 2 mm and reactive, and extraocular movements are normal by oculocephalic manoeuvres. She has no papilloedema on direct ophthalmoscopy. With stimulation there is decerebrate posturing that resolves spontaneously. On cardiac examination she has a gallop rhythm. Her liver is palpable 2cm below the right costal margin and her spleen is 4cm below the left costal margin. A rapid test for glucose is normal.\n\nLaboratory results on admission reveal a haematocrit of 17.6%, which is below the reference range of ≥30, and a platelet count of 28 ×10⁹/L, below the reference range of 150-450. The malaria rapid diagnostic test was positive, while the reference standard is negative."}

Metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycaemia, or renal or hepatic failure) and non-convulsive status epilepticus may be primary causes of coma or complicate these infectious and toxic aetiologies. Although there is no neck stiffness, she is deeply comatose, making this clinical finding less reliable; the absence of neck stiffness should not lower the clinician's suspicion of meningitis. Rapid testing shows that hypoglycaemia is not the cause of the child's abnormal mental status and it has been 4 hours since her last clinical seizure, making a post-ictal state unlikely."}

This clinical diagnosis is, however, non-specific because of high rates of asymptomatic parasitaemia in those geographical areas where malaria is most common and the abundance of differential diagnoses."}

Initially, this produces clinical illness (either uncomplicated or complicated malaria); but with repeated infectious challenges, a state of asymptomatic parasitaemia may be attained. Therefore in African children in a coma, a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out an underlying non-malarial aetiology of acute illness. In parasitaemic African children in a coma, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy may be useful in differentiating malarial from non-malarial aetiologies of coma (see Summary Box)."}

If available, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be useful to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus as either a primary coma aetiology or a contributor to illness. More sophisticated laboratory evaluations (creatinine, electrolytes, bilirubin) may be useful but are seldom available in the geographical contexts where malaria is most prevalent."}

The presence of one or more retinal findings (retinal whitening, haemorrhages or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema) would lend support to a malarial aetiology of acute illness (Fig. 4.1). Children with retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria may be more likely to have a non-malarial aetiology for their coma. As both retinopathy-negative and retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria may be complicated by bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, seizures and/or metabolic abnormalities, a complete work-up for non-malarial coma aetiologies (including non-convulsive status epilepticus) is indicated in all patients presenting with WHO clinically defined cerebral malaria."}

Blood cultures were taken, and mydriatic drops instilled to perform ophthalmoscopy. This revealed white-centred haemorrhages in both eyes. A diagnosis of retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria was made.\nAfter administration of artesunate 2.4 mg/kg IV in A&E, the child was admitted to the high-dependency section of the hospital's paediatric unit for frequent monitoring of vital signs and serum glucose. Artesunate was repeated at 12 and 24 hours and then once daily. An EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Twelve hours after admission the child had one short (1 minute) generalized seizure that spontaneously resolved and did not recur. Forty hours after admission her Blantyre Coma Score was 4/5. The child was discharged home on hospital day five, with a follow-up appointment in the neurology clinic scheduled after 4 weeks."}

In autopsy studies, identification of malarial retinopathy during life was 95% sensitive and 100% specific for the post-mortem identification of sequestered parasitized erythrocytes in cerebral vasculature. Sequestered parasitized erythrocytes in the CNS are a pathological hallmark of cerebral malaria and likely indicate that acute malarial infection was responsible for the patient's illness and death. In these autopsy studies, children who fulfilled WHO clinical criteria for cerebral malaria but lacked malarial retinopathy (i.e. they had retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria) had other non-malarial aetiologies of death on autopsy, including systemic infections (pneumonia) and Reye syndrome"}
