The most important underlying aetiologies of coma to consider are cerebral malaria, acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis and intoxication (particularly organophosphates). Metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycaemia, or renal or hepatic failure) and non-convulsive status epilepticus may be primary causes of coma or complicate these infectious and toxic aetiologies. Although there is no neck stiffness, she is deeply comatose, making this clinical finding less reliable; the absence of neck stiffness should not lower the clinician's suspicion of meningitis. Rapid testing shows that hypoglycaemia is not the cause of the child's abnormal mental status and it has been 4 hours since her last clinical seizure, making a post-ictal state unlikely.
