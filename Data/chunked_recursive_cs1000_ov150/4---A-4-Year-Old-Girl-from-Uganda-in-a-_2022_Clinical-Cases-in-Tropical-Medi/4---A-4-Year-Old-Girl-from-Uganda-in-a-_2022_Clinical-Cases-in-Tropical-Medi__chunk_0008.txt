An ophthalmoscopic examination to evaluate for malarial retinopathy may be helpful. The presence of one or more retinal findings (retinal whitening, haemorrhages or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema) would lend support to a malarial aetiology of acute illness (Fig. 4.1). Children with retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria may be more likely to have a non-malarial aetiology for their coma. As both retinopathy-negative and retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria may be complicated by bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, seizures and/or metabolic abnormalities, a complete work-up for non-malarial coma aetiologies (including non-convulsive status epilepticus) is indicated in all patients presenting with WHO clinically defined cerebral malaria.
