A contrast-enhanced CT scan of her abdomen shows multiple hypodense, non-enhancing lesions in the liver.

1. What are your differential diagnoses?
2. What would be the most useful investigation to establish the diagnosis?

A young woman from the Peruvian Andes presents with a history of fever, weight loss and abdominal pain. The blood count reveals pronounced eosinophilia. The abdominal CT scan shows hypodense non-enhancing hepatic lesions.

The patient was first treated for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses based upon the presence of fever, right upper abdominal pain and hypoechoic liver lesions on ultrasound.

However, the lack of any improvement after 3 days of appropriate treatment makes this diagnosis less likely.
