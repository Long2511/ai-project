Fascioliasis is caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica or less frequently F. gigantica. Fascioliasis has the widest latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal distribution of any known zoonotic diseases. It is a serious public health problem, with between 2.4 and 17 million infected people worldwide and around 90 million at risk. In South America, the infection is encountered in the Andean countries, in particular in Bolivia and Peru. Egypt is another country with a very high prevalence of fascioliasis.

Ova of Fasciola species are shed in the faeces of herbivores. Once they reach fresh water, miracidia hatch and infect a snail which acts as an intermediate host. Additional development takes place inside the snail, then cercariae are released into the water. They develop into infective encysted metacercariae on freshwater plants. Humans acquire the disease by eating watercress (salads) or drinking water contaminated with metacercariae.
