At the beginning of the subsequent latent phase the parasites have crossed the liver parenchyma to finally reach the common bile duct, where they mature and start depositing eggs. Ova appear in the stool 3 to 4 months after the ingestion of infective metacercariae. The latent phase is characterized by the progressive resolution of gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. An unknown percentage of patients will progress to the fourth phase of the disease characterized by biliary obstruction, cholelithiasis, ascending cholangitis, cholecystitis, or liver abscess. Haemorrhage (e.g. subcapsular haematomas), hepatic fibrosis or biliary cirrhosis might also be observed.

During the acute phase, diagnosis of human fascioliasis is based on clinical and radiological findings and immunodiagnostic assays such as the Fas2-ELISA. Eosinophilia is usually present.
