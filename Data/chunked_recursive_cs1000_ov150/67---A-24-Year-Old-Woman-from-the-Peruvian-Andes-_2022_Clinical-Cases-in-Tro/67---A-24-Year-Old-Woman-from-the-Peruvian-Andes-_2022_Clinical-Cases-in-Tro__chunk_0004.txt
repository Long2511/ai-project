However, the lack of any improvement after 3 days of appropriate treatment makes this diagnosis less likely.

In a patient from the Andes with high eosinophilia and a known history of alfalfa and watercress consumption, fascioliasis is the most important diagnosis to consider. Amoebic liver abscess is also part of the differential diagnosis, but eosinophilia and the presence of multiple lesions are not typical. Also, the infection is uncommon in young women and should respond to metronidazole treatment.

Other endemic infections in Peru that could present with similar symptoms are brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis or secondary infections in the context of other infections (i.e. ascariasis and hydatid disease). Opisthorchis, another liver fluke, could be considered if the patient had a travel history to South-east Asia, as the condition is not present in the Americas.
