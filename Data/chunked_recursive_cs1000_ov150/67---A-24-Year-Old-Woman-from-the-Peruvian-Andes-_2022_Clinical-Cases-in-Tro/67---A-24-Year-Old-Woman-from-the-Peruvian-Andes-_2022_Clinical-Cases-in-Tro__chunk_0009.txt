During chronic infection, eosinophilia is rare but ova can be detected on stool microscopy. The yield can be improved using rapid sedimentation techniques. Microscopic detection of eggs is considered definitive diagnosis of fascioliasis. Eggs may also accidentally be discovered during surgery for biliary obstruction.

Triclabendazole is the anthelmintic drug of choice. In acute cases a single dose of triclabendazole at 10mg/kg is effective in almost 90% of cases and the same regimen is used in chronic disease. Triclabendazole should be taken with food to increase its bioavailability. Triclabendazole resistance seems to be an emerging problem.
