A 24-year-old woman from the highlands of Peru is transferred to a hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain, weight loss (5 kg), nausea and vomiting. She tried analgesics, which did not control the pain. She also reports intermittent fevers for the past 2 weeks.

Three days previously, she was seen at the emergency room of the same hospital for the above-mentioned complaints. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in her liver. She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses but did not show any clinical improvement.

The patient reported that about 2 to 3 months ago she started taking over-the-counter medicines to lose weight and changed her diet to vegetarian food. She also reported the consumption of energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. Prior to her current illness, she was healthy. She is single and has no children.
