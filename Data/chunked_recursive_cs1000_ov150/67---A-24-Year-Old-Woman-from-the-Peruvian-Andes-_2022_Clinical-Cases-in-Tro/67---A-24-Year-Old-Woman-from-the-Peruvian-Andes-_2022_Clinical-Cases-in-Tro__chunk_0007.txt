The illness includes four clinical phases: (1) incubation phase, (2) invasive or acute phase, (3) latent phase and (4) obstructive or chronic phase. The incubation phase lasts from ingestion of metacercariae to first symptoms (6-12 weeks). The invasive or acute phase begins with flukes migrating through the small intestinal wall, the peritoneal cavity, the liver capsule and the liver parenchyma.

During the acute phase, lasting 3 to 5 months, the patients typically present with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria and respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, dyspnoea and chest pain). Less common findings include changes in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, anaemia and jaundice. Eosinophilia is almost always present during the acute phase.
