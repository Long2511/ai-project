Infection with the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) is top of the list of differential diagnoses in this patient with liver lesions, eosinophilia and a history of watercress consumption.

Because ova appear in the stool only later in the course of the disease, serology is the diagnostic tool of choice. The Fas2 ELISA is a serological method with good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose the acute phase of F. hepatica infection.

Liver biopsy is invasive and has little benefit in this context; it could be considered if tests are negative and all treatments fail.

The Fas2 ELISA titre was 0.56 (normal <0.2), supporting the suspected diagnosis of fascioliasis. The patient received one single dose of triclabendazole 10 mg/kg. Her clinical symptoms rapidly improved and her laboratory parameters went back to normal. On control tomography her liver lesions were seen to be disappearing.
