Given the bleeding tendency seen in the wife, most viral haemorrhagic fevers can be excluded based on the incubation time alone, which is well below 21 days for most endemic viral haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, dengue and the New World arenaviruses, e.g. Junín virus and Machupo virus). There is only one exception to this rule, which is hantavirus infections: their incubation time may be up to 35 days.

Both patients should be referred to a tertiary care setting, which is equipped to handle ARDS and haemorrhagic fevers. Clinically, securing cardiorespiratory function is the main priority. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated as empirical treatment until further results are back.

Although the aetiology is still unclear, a patient with respiratory symptoms must be treated under standard hygiene and droplet precautions (at least) to prevent potential nosocomial transmission. Depending on local hospital hygiene requirements, airborne precautions may be required.
