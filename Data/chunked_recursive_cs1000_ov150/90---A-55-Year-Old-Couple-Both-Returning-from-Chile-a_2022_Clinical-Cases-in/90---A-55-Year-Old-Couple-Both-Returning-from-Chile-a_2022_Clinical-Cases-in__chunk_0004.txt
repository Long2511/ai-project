A previously healthy Swiss couple in their mid-50s present with varying degrees of cardiorespiratory failure of 2 and 21 days, respectively, after their return from a 3-month trip down the western coast of South America. They spent the last month travelling along the Chile-Argentinian border. The cardiorespiratory collapse in the female patient occurs precipitously and requires ECMO treatment.

Conditions that may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible multi-organ failure after travel to South America include influenza and other respiratory viruses. Of the viral infections, New World hantaviruses cause cardiopulmonary disease; their incubation period is comparatively long and human-to-human transmission has been described, which could explain why husband and wife presented 3 weeks apart.
