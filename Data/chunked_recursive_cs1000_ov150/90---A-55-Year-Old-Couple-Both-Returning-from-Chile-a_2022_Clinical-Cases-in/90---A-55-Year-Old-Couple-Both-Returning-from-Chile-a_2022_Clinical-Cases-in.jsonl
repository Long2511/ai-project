The last month of their trip they spent hiking, camping and taking occasional mud baths in the Chile-Argentinian border region. On their flight back to Switzerland, the husband developed a fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias and generalized weakness that did not respond to symptomatic treatment. At presentation at the hospital in Switzerland 4 days later, he continued to be febrile and felt too weak to walk to the toilet unassisted or even hold up a newspaper. He developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates were seen on chest x-ray."}

The following day he was transferred to the intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilator support.\n\nThree weeks later, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly over the 24 hours after admission, developed cardiorespiratory failure and fulfilled fast-entry criteria for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Furthermore, she experienced multi-organ failure requiring hemodialysis, and she developed profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation. During the following days, she required mass transfusions of blood products."}

No abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation.\nWife on admission (3 weeks after her husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).

They spent the last month travelling along the Chile-Argentinian border. The cardiorespiratory collapse in the female patient occurs precipitously and requires ECMO treatment.\n\nConditions that may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible multi-organ failure after travel to South America include influenza and other respiratory viruses. Of the viral infections, New World hantaviruses cause cardiopulmonary disease; their incubation period is comparatively long and human-to-human transmission has been described, which could explain why husband and wife presented 3 weeks apart."}

Rickettsial diseases have to be considered: of the spotted-fever group, in particular Rickettsia rickettsiae, which notoriously causes severe disease should be on the list of differentials; and scrub typhus, which was long thought to be limited to Asia, has recently been described from Chile. Pulmonary plague is also focally endemic in South America. Fungal infections (Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis) also have to be considered. Severe malaria may cause ARDS and is a possibility, too."}

There is only one exception to this rule, which is hantavirus infections: their incubation time may be up to 35 days.\n\nBoth patients should be referred to a tertiary care setting, which is equipped to handle ARDS and haemorrhagic fevers. Clinically, securing cardiorespiratory function is the main priority. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated as empirical treatment until further results are back.\n\nAlthough the aetiology is still unclear, a patient with respiratory symptoms must be treated under standard hygiene and droplet precautions (at least) to prevent potential nosocomial transmission. Depending on local hospital hygiene requirements, airborne precautions may be required."}

He made a full recovery after a month of rehabilitation. His wife experienced a dramatic course with nearly a full month on ECMO treatment. Multi-organ failure requiring renal replacement therapy and haemorrhagic complications with mass transfusions of blood products ensued. As a result of bleeding complications at the inguinal ECMO insertion sites (compartment syndrome and leg ischemia) ECMO was replaced centrally. After additional bleeding complications at inguinal and thoracic insertion sites, she underwent several surgical interventions. Nosocomial infections followed, and she remained in intensive care for 5 months and an additional 12 months in rehabilitation. The mode of transmission remained unclear; both human-to-human-transmission and acquisition from a common source were possible."}
{"id": "90---A-55-Year-Old-Couple-Both-Returning-from-Chile-a_2022_Clinical-Cases-in__0009", "text": "HCPS is caused by ANDV. This New World hantavirus is endemic in the border region between Chile and Argentina. The vast majority of infections occur through inhalation of excreta from the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), the reservoir host. Accordingly, outdoor activities are the major risk factor for acquiring ANDV infection.\n\nThe incubation period is typically 2 to 3 weeks (range 7-39 days) in case of common exposure.\n\nAfter non-specific prodromal symptoms over 2 to 8 days, the clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. It presents with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability because of cardiogenic shock and consecutive pulmonary oedema. Capillary leak leads to hypovolemia, which may further impair cardiac and renal function. A haemorrhagic course may occur, although uncommon."}

The use of ribavirin and corticosteroids in ANDV infection still remains to be elucidated. Organ supportive therapy is therefore the mainstay of treatment. Patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection, because ECMO support might be required. Case fatality rate in patients with HCPS attributable to ANDV is 20% to 40%.\n\nANDV is the only hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been described, though this occurs very rarely."}

The incubation period in such a scenario is usually around 20 days. Person-to-person transmission is much less common than infection by inhalation of rodent excreta and occurs through close interpersonal contacts in the hospital setting (caring for a person with respiratory or haemorrhagic symptoms) or at home (such as sexual contacts, deep kissing or sharing the same bed).\n\nIn the nosocomial setting, standard hygiene and droplet precautions should be adopted, and it is recommended to treat the patients in a single room. During aerosol-generating procedures, however, healthcare workers are advised to wear high-efficiency respirator masks and ocular protection."}
