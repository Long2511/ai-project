Pneumococcal pneumonia should also be in the differential diagnosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. Rickettsial diseases have to be considered: of the spotted-fever group, in particular Rickettsia rickettsiae, which notoriously causes severe disease should be on the list of differentials; and scrub typhus, which was long thought to be limited to Asia, has recently been described from Chile. Pulmonary plague is also focally endemic in South America. Fungal infections (Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis) also have to be considered. Severe malaria may cause ARDS and is a possibility, too.
