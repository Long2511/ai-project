ANDV is the only hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been described, though this occurs very rarely.

Nosocomial outbreaks were first reported in 1995. The incubation period in such a scenario is usually around 20 days. Person-to-person transmission is much less common than infection by inhalation of rodent excreta and occurs through close interpersonal contacts in the hospital setting (caring for a person with respiratory or haemorrhagic symptoms) or at home (such as sexual contacts, deep kissing or sharing the same bed).

In the nosocomial setting, standard hygiene and droplet precautions should be adopted, and it is recommended to treat the patients in a single room. During aerosol-generating procedures, however, healthcare workers are advised to wear high-efficiency respirator masks and ocular protection.
