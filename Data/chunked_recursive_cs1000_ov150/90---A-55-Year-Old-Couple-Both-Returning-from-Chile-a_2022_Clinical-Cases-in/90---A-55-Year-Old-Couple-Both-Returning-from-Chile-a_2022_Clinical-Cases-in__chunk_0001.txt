A 55-year-old Swiss couple, both fitness instructors, travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile. The last month of their trip they spent hiking, camping and taking occasional mud baths in the Chile-Argentinian border region. On their flight back to Switzerland, the husband developed a fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias and generalized weakness that did not respond to symptomatic treatment. At presentation at the hospital in Switzerland 4 days later, he continued to be febrile and felt too weak to walk to the toilet unassisted or even hold up a newspaper. He developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates were seen on chest x-ray.
