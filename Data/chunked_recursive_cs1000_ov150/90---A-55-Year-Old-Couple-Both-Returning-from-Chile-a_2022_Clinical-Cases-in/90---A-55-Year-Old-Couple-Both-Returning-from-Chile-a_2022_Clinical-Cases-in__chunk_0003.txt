Husband: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). No abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation.
Wife on admission (3 weeks after her husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F). No abnormal findings on auscultation.

On the husband's admission, his WCC was 7.3 G/L (reference: 3.0-10.5), with 35% band neutrophils; platelets were 48 G/L (reference: 150-450); CRP was 68 mg/L (reference: <5); glomerular filtration rate was greater than 90 mL/min (reference: >90 mL/min); and transaminases were normal. On the wife's admission, her WCC was 1.88 G/L; platelets were 98 G/L; CRP was 7 mg/L; glomerular filtration rate was greater than 90 mL/min; and transaminases were normal.

Chest radiography at presentation was normal in both patients; however, during the course of the disease both developed extensive bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusions.
