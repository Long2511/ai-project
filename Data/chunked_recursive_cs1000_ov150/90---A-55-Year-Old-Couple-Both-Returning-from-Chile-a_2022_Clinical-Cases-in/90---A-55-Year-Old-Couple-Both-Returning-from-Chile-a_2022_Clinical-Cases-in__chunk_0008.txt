The husband was treated with non-invasive ventilation for 5 days. He made a full recovery after a month of rehabilitation. His wife experienced a dramatic course with nearly a full month on ECMO treatment. Multi-organ failure requiring renal replacement therapy and haemorrhagic complications with mass transfusions of blood products ensued. As a result of bleeding complications at the inguinal ECMO insertion sites (compartment syndrome and leg ischemia) ECMO was replaced centrally. After additional bleeding complications at inguinal and thoracic insertion sites, she underwent several surgical interventions. Nosocomial infections followed, and she remained in intensive care for 5 months and an additional 12 months in rehabilitation. The mode of transmission remained unclear; both human-to-human-transmission and acquisition from a common source were possible.
