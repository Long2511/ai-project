HCPS is caused by ANDV. This New World hantavirus is endemic in the border region between Chile and Argentina. The vast majority of infections occur through inhalation of excreta from the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), the reservoir host. Accordingly, outdoor activities are the major risk factor for acquiring ANDV infection.

The incubation period is typically 2 to 3 weeks (range 7-39 days) in case of common exposure.

After non-specific prodromal symptoms over 2 to 8 days, the clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. It presents with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability because of cardiogenic shock and consecutive pulmonary oedema. Capillary leak leads to hypovolemia, which may further impair cardiac and renal function. A haemorrhagic course may occur, although uncommon.
