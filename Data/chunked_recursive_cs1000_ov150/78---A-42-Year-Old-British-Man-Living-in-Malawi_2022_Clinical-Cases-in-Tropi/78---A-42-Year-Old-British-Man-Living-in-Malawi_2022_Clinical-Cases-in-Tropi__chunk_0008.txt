According to the standard treatment guidelines for Human African Trypanosomiasis, the approach varies by the species and stage of the disease. For first-stage West African trypanosomiasis (T. brucei gambiense), treatment options include Pentamidine administered intramuscularly or intravenously once daily for 7 days, or Fexinidazole taken orally once daily for 10 days. For first-stage East African trypanosomiasis (T. brucei rhodesiense), treatment is either Suramin administered intravenously in 6 injections, for example on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21, or Pentamidine given intramuscularly or intravenously once daily for 7 days. In cases of second-stage West African trypanosomiasis, treatment consists of Nifurtimox-Eflornithine combination therapy, which involves Nifurtimox taken orally three times a day for 10 days plus Eflornithine administered intravenously twice daily for 7 days, or alternatively, Fexinidazole taken orally once daily for 10 days
