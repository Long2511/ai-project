With a story of possible tick bite, a positive family history of allergy, a history of bee keeping, an asthmatic episode after insect bites 9 months previously in addition to the dramatic clinical presentation of urticarial rash and anaphylactic shock, the initial diagnosis was of a possible hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials to include are inva- sive helminthiasis such as acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), acute fascioliasis and Loeffler's syndrome (the acute pulmonary stage of infection with Ascaris lumbricoides); rickettsial disease; and connective tissue disease. Both in allergic reactions and in invasive helminth infections though, eosinophilia would be typical which is absent in this case.

A firm diagnosis has not been made and he needs to remain in the hospital under observation receiving treatment as needed for his intermittent allergic manifestations.
