The patient was diagnosed with HAT. East African trypano- somiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense) appears epidemiologically and clinically likely. It is primarily a zoonosis, and animal reservoir hosts include domestic and game animals; its clinical course therefore tends to be rapid with a high case fatality rate if untreated. In contrast, West African trypanosomiasis is considered an anthroponotic disease. The parasite, T. brucei gambiense, is adapted to the human host, causing chronic symptoms and leading to the classic picture of "sleeping sickness", i.e. a chronic encephalopathy.
