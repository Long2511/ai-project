The reasons for the dramatic presentation of trypanosomiasis with anaphylaxis as with the case of this patient can only be speculative, but his "allergic" preponderance may have made him hypersensitive to the invasive trypanosomes as they migrated from the subcutaneous tissues of the chancre to the blood. Gold standard of diagnosis is the demonstration of trypanosomes in blood smears by microscopy. Why trypanosomes were not identified in the first blood smear 24 hours after his illness started is not clear - they may not have been present in sufficient numbers in the blood at that stage or they may have been missed by the laboratory technician who was focused on searching for malaria parasites. Suramin is the treatment of choice for early stage East African trypanosomiasis. It needs to be administered carefully with an initial test dose in case of hypersensitivity reactions. It is potentially nephrotoxic, hence the need for urine monitoring.
