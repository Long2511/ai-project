All patients should be tested for HIV, ova of Schistosoma spp. in urine and stool and evidence of TB or neoplasia on chest- and spinal radiography. If available, ultrasound examination of the abdomen is very valuable in tumour-screening and TB work-up. CSF should be examined, which is of particular importance in immunosuppressed patients.

Realistically, most patients admitted to hospital with paraplegia because of spinal cord disease will leave the hospital paraplegic. The prognosis is overall poor, and often the secondary complications rather than the primary pathology dictate the further course of the disease. The prevention of complications of spinal cord disease is therefore of paramount importance. Health workers should work hand in hand with guardians, physiotherapists and the local palliative care team.
