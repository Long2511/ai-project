For spinal tuberculosis, diagnostic clues include a typical spinal radiograph and epidemiological evidence, with treatment consisting of antituberculous medication and spinal surgery if available and applicable. For spinal metastases, diagnostic clues consist of clinical evidence of a primary tumour, such as in the prostate or breast, and treatment options are very limited, involving corticosteroids to reduce oedema, as radiotherapy is rarely available. For transverse myelitis, including autoimmune types, diagnostic clues are that it affects young adults and causes inflammatory CSF, with corticosteroids being the treatment. For schistosomiasis, diagnostic clues include exposure to freshwater in endemic regions, presentation in young adults in endemic countries or non-immune travellers, CSF eosinophilia, and other manifestations of schistosomiasis, which may or may not be present; treatment involves praziquantel and corticosteroids.
