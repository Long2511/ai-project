The clinical signs – spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes and thoracic sensory level – localize the lesion to the spinal cord. The bladder is usually involved in spinal cord disease, but the absence of bladder symptoms does not rule out spinal cord involvement, particularly in slowly progressive lesions, as in our case.

Spinal cord disease can be traumatic or non-traumatic. Nothing in the patient's history suggests trauma. Non-traumatic spinal cord disease can be compressive or non-compressive. Compressive disease is sometimes amenable to spinal surgery.

Common causes of adult non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in sub-Saharan Africa are spinal TB (‘Pott's disease'), spinal metastases and degenerative spinal disease including slipped disc. Common causes of non-compressive spinal cord disease are schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.
