The patient was found to be HIV-positive. His urine dipstick was normal and there were no ova of Schistosoma spp. detected in his urine and stool. The spinal radiograph showed a collapse of T11 vertebral body as well as soft tissue swelling around the spine (Fig. 11.2). Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examination were normal.

A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment. Vitamin B6 was prescribed to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counselling were initiated at the hospital. The patient was reviewed by a spinal surgeon who did not recommend surgical intervention at that time, but suggested a review 3 months later. The patient was discharged home. The hospital palliative care team was involved and put him on their list for monthly home visits.
