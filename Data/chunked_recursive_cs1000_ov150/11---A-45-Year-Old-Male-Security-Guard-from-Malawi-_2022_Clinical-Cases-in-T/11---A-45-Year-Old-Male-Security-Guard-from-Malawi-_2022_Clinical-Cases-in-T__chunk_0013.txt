Progression of bone destruction may continue for up to 1 year after effective antituberculous treatment has been initiated and should not be taken as a sign of treatment failure. Adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is not recommended for spinal TB. However, some centres use steroids in severe spinal cord compression to reduce oedematous swelling, which is a non-evidence-based approach. Surgery has been recommended for patients with (1) extensive extradural compression with features of spinal cord involvement, (2) no improvement or worsening of deficits after conservative treatment and (3) potentially unstable spine or kyphosis of more than 60 degrees. Surgical treatment relieves compression of the spinal cord, corrects kyphosis, may facilitate fusion and lead to faster pain relief.
