Spinal TB is the most common cause of tuberculous paraplegia and represents two-thirds of cases. Other causes are tuberculous radiculomyelitis (= arachnoiditis), tuberculous myelitis and intramedullary tuberculoma.

Constitutional symptoms are absent in more than half of patients, and simultaneous active pulmonary involvement is rather the exception than the rule. Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) are elevated in most cases and may be used as a screening method for patients from endemic regions presenting with back pain. Spinal radiographs may typically show focal areas of erosions and osseous destruction in the anterior corners of the vertebral bodies, involvement of the adjacent disc or vertebral body, 'wedging,' gibbus deformity or paraspinal abscess formation.

Compressive spinal cord involvement is a common and most feared complication caused by accumulation of epidural caseous debris or by vertebral collapse or dislocation.
