A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi is admitted to a local tertiary hospital because of back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.

His troubles started 1 year earlier with back pain and he presented to a local health centre. He was given paracetamol and sent home. The pain did not improve. Over the following weeks he also developed difficulty in walking and 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs.

Three months after the first visit he presented again to the same health centre. His temperature was slightly elevated (37.5°C, 99.5°F). He was given antimalarials, a single dose of praziquantel and paracetamol. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and his back (Fig. 11.1A). Over the following 6 months his condition further deteriorated and he finally became bedridden.
