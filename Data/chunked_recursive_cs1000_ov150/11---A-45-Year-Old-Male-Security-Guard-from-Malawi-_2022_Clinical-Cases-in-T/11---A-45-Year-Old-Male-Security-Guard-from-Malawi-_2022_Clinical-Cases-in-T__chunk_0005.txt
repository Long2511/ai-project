The diagnosis of spinal cord disease in resource-limited settings is often clinical. Spinal tuberculosis has an insidious, chronically progressive onset over weeks, with months of back pain; its clinical features include common spasticity, a bladder that may be spared, and potential spinal deformity on examination. Spinal metastases present with a subacute, chronically progressive onset over weeks, causing spasticity or flaccidity, and the bladder may also be spared. Transverse myelitis, including autoimmune types, has an acute onset that is often non-progressive, with common bladder involvement. Schistosomiasis has an acute onset over days or a subacute onset over a couple of weeks, frequently causing flaccid paresis and common bladder involvement. Management should focus on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying aetiology and on prevention and treatment of the complications of spinal cord disease.
