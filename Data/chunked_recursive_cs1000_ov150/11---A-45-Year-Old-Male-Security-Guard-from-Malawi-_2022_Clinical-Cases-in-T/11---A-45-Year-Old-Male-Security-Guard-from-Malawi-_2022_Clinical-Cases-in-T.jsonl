He was given paracetamol and sent home. The pain did not improve. Over the following weeks he also developed difficulty in walking and 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs.\n\nThree months after the first visit he presented again to the same health centre. His temperature was slightly elevated (37.5°C, 99.5°F). He was given antimalarials, a single dose of praziquantel and paracetamol. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and his back (Fig. 11.1A). Over the following 6 months his condition further deteriorated and he finally became bedridden."}

There is neither haematuria nor diarrhoea and he is continent for stool and urine. There is no history of trauma or past tuberculosis (TB). He has never been tested for HIV.\n\nHe is a non-smoker, but drinks two paper cartons (about one litre) of Chibuku, a locally brewed beer, per day. He is married with three children, who are all well. He resides in an urban area and used to work as a security guard but has been unemployed for the last 6 months because of his illness."}

There is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs (Fig. 11.1B). The power in his legs is 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs are exaggerated. The plantar reflexes are upgoing.

The bladder is usually involved in spinal cord disease, but the absence of bladder symptoms does not rule out spinal cord involvement, particularly in slowly progressive lesions, as in our case.\n\nSpinal cord disease can be traumatic or non-traumatic. Nothing in the patient's history suggests trauma. Non-traumatic spinal cord disease can be compressive or non-compressive. Compressive disease is sometimes amenable to spinal surgery.\n\nCommon causes of adult non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in sub-Saharan Africa are spinal TB (‘Pott's disease'), spinal metastases and degenerative spinal disease including slipped disc. Common causes of non-compressive spinal cord disease are schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy."}

Spinal tuberculosis has an insidious, chronically progressive onset over weeks, with months of back pain; its clinical features include common spasticity, a bladder that may be spared, and potential spinal deformity on examination. Spinal metastases present with a subacute, chronically progressive onset over weeks, causing spasticity or flaccidity, and the bladder may also be spared. Transverse myelitis, including autoimmune types, has an acute onset that is often non-progressive, with common bladder involvement. Schistosomiasis has an acute onset over days or a subacute onset over a couple of weeks, frequently causing flaccid paresis and common bladder involvement. Management should focus on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying aetiology and on prevention and treatment of the complications of spinal cord disease."}

For spinal metastases, diagnostic clues consist of clinical evidence of a primary tumour, such as in the prostate or breast, and treatment options are very limited, involving corticosteroids to reduce oedema, as radiotherapy is rarely available. For transverse myelitis, including autoimmune types, diagnostic clues are that it affects young adults and causes inflammatory CSF, with corticosteroids being the treatment. For schistosomiasis, diagnostic clues include exposure to freshwater in endemic regions, presentation in young adults in endemic countries or non-immune travellers, CSF eosinophilia, and other manifestations of schistosomiasis, which may or may not be present; treatment involves praziquantel and corticosteroids."}

If available, ultrasound examination of the abdomen is very valuable in tumour-screening and TB work-up. CSF should be examined, which is of particular importance in immunosuppressed patients.\n\nRealistically, most patients admitted to hospital with paraplegia because of spinal cord disease will leave the hospital paraplegic. The prognosis is overall poor, and often the secondary complications rather than the primary pathology dictate the further course of the disease. The prevention of complications of spinal cord disease is therefore of paramount importance. Health workers should work hand in hand with guardians, physiotherapists and the local palliative care team."}

Urinary retention is managed with catheterization. Contractures are managed with physiotherapy and by training guardians for home-based physiotherapy. Pain can be managed with pain relief by NSAIDs or opiates and the involvement of a local palliative care team. Immobilization can be addressed by prescribing walking aids or wheelchairs if available. Depression is managed through spiritual and mental support, occupational therapy or community projects, pharmacotherapy, and the involvement of a local palliative care team."}

His urine dipstick was normal and there were no ova of Schistosoma spp. detected in his urine and stool. The spinal radiograph showed a collapse of T11 vertebral body as well as soft tissue swelling around the spine (Fig. 11.2). Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examination were normal.\n\nA presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment. Vitamin B6 was prescribed to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counselling were initiated at the hospital. The patient was reviewed by a spinal surgeon who did not recommend surgical intervention at that time, but suggested a review 3 months later. The patient was discharged home. The hospital palliative care team was involved and put him on their list for monthly home visits."}

His neurological deficits were unchanged. His CD4 count was 331 cells/µL and he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\n\nAt the 3-month follow-up by the palliative care team, the patient reported some subjective improvement in his gait. Clinically though, his deficits remained unchanged. He was taking his antituberculous and antiretroviral medication regularly and was still waiting for a wheelchair. He did not attend the neurosurgical outpatient clinic because of problems with transportation.\n\nSpinal TB is a collective term for spinal involvement in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It comprises tuberculous spondylitis, tuberculous spondylodiscitis and tuberculous epidural and paraspinal abscess. Often, all manifestations occur together."}

Other causes are tuberculous radiculomyelitis (= arachnoiditis), tuberculous myelitis and intramedullary tuberculoma.\n\nConstitutional symptoms are absent in more than half of patients, and simultaneous active pulmonary involvement is rather the exception than the rule. Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) are elevated in most cases and may be used as a screening method for patients from endemic regions presenting with back pain. Spinal radiographs may typically show focal areas of erosions and osseous destruction in the anterior corners of the vertebral bodies, involvement of the adjacent disc or vertebral body, 'wedging,' gibbus deformity or paraspinal abscess formation.\n\nCompressive spinal cord involvement is a common and most feared complication caused by accumulation of epidural caseous debris or by vertebral collapse or dislocation."}

If biopsy is available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technology such as GeneXpert might expedite the diagnostic process and allow the early recognition of antibiotic resistance.\n\nAntituberculous therapy is the same as for pulmonary TB; however, most national guidelines and centres recommend longer treatment for nine instead of 6 months."}

Adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is not recommended for spinal TB. However, some centres use steroids in severe spinal cord compression to reduce oedematous swelling, which is a non-evidence-based approach. Surgery has been recommended for patients with (1) extensive extradural compression with features of spinal cord involvement, (2) no improvement or worsening of deficits after conservative treatment and (3) potentially unstable spine or kyphosis of more than 60 degrees. Surgical treatment relieves compression of the spinal cord, corrects kyphosis, may facilitate fusion and lead to faster pain relief."}
