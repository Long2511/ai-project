This young man presents with combined left-sided cardiac failure and renal failure. He was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years prior. It is unclear if his renal incompetence is a cause or the result of his raised blood pressure.
The reason for the enlargement of his kidneys could either be primary (e.g. polycystic kidneys) or secondary as a result of post-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis. In renal com promise secondary to hypertension, one would expect the kidneys to be small.
Being a fisherman, the patient has been in regular contact with Schistosoma haematobium-infested water in Lake Malawi. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis is one of the top differential diagnoses to suspect.
