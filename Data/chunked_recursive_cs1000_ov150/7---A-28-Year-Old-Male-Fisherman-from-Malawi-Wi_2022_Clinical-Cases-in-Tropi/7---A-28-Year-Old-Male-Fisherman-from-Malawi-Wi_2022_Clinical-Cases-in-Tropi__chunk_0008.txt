Genitourinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium is endemic in large parts of Africa and in the Middle East. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common tropical diseases in migrants from endemic countries and should actively be screened for.
About 50% of Schistosoma eggs are shed through urine, the other half remain trapped in the tissue causing granulomatous inflammation. Around 10% of people infected progress to chronic late-stage disease. Risk factors for disease progression are poorly understood and include intensity and duration of infection, host genetic factors and parasite strain differences.
Chronic infection leads to granulomatous inflammation of bladder wall and ureteral mucosa resulting in obstructive uropathy, hydronephrosis, recurrent bacterial pyelonephritis and end-stage renal disease. It is also suspected to contribute to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. The pathological changes can long go unnoticed.
