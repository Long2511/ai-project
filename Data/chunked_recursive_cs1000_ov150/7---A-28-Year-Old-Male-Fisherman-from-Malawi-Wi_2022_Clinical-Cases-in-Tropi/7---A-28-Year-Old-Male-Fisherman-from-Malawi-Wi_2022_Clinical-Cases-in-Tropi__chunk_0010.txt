In advanced stages of schistosomiasis, the proof of Schistosoma eggs in the urine is challenging because the adult flukes may have long died and egg production may have stopped. Biopsy is often unavailable and serology is unhelpful in an endemic setting, because it can only detect exposure without indicating the activity, duration or quantum of infection. A promising point-of-care diagnostic tool may be circulating anodic antigen (CAA), which is under development.
The investigation of choice is ultrasound. Hydronephrosis and bladder wall abnormalities can easily be demonstrated.
On cystoscopy a hyperaemic mucosa with 'sandy patches' may be seen (Fig. 7.2). Sandy patches are raised, yellowish mucosal irregularities associated with heavy egg deposition surrounded by fibrous tissue pathognomonic for schistosomiasis.
