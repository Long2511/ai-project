The most useful investigation at this point is an ultrasound of the kidneys to differentiate between, primary renal patholog ical condition and a post-renal problem. If there was hydro nephrosis, obstruction at the level of the bladder seems most likely because both kidneys appear enlarged.
On cystoscopy, endoscopists can macroscopically estab lish the diagnosis, but ideally, biopsies should be performed to look for evidence of granulomatous inflammation and S. haematobium ova in the tissue and to rule out neoplasia. In chronic infection, urine microscopy may be negative for ova of S. haematobium.
