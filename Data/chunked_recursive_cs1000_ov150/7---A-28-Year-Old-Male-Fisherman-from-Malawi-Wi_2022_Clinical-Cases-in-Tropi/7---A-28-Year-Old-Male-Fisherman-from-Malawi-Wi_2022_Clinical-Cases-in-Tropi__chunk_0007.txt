The next day the patient deteriorated. He became drowsy and vomited repeatedly. He got progressively bradycardic, and there was a new pericardial friction rub suggestive of uraemic pericarditis.
He was taken to theatre and a bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was done. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started (haemodialysis was not available).
The patient improved rapidly, vomiting and drowsiness ceased and his friction rub disappeared. He was discharged home on PD.
Two months later he was readmitted with fever and abdominal pain. He was treated for suspected bacterial peri tonitis but sadly died 3 weeks later still in the hospital.
