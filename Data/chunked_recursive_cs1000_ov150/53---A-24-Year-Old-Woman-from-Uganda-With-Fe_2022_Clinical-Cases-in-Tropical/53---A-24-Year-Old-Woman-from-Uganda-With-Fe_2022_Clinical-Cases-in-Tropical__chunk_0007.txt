EVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of MHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines, whereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating apes or monkeys.

Filoviruses can spread between people through direct physi cal contact or contact with infected body fluids. Large nosocomial outbreaks involving the death of large numbers of medical staff have been recorded. Therefore strict infection control measures should be followed while caring for anyone with a suspected viral haemorrhagic fever. Vaccines against MVD are under develop ment but have not yet been tested on humans.
