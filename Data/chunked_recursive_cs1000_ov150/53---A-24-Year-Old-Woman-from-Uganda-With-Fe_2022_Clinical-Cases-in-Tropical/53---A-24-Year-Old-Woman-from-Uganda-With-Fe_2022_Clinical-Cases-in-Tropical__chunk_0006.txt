Marburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are both caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin guishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate. Symptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and abdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre quent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die develop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Because symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in most of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an outbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should raise the suspicion towards FHF.
