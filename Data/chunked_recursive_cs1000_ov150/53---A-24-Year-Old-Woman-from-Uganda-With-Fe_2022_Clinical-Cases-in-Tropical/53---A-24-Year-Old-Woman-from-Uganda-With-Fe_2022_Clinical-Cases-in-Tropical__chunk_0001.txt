A 24-year-old woman presents to a small hospital in rural Uganda because of a 5-day history of a febrile illness. Apart from fever, the illness started with a sore throat and aching all over. She also developed some abdominal pain and diar-rhoea. The patient has become increasingly unwell over the course of the past days. She is very weak and needs help to stand.

Her husband died of a severe febrile illness 6 days before she became ill. He had worked in a local gold mine and had previously been in good health. He had fallen ill about a week before his death. His wife had looked after him during his final illness and he had died at home.

The patient looks very unwell. Her blood pressure is 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate 105 bpm, temperature 38°C (100.4°F). She has bilateral conjunctivitis. There is no rash and no lymphadenopathy. The heart sounds are normal and her chest is clear. Her abdominal examination is normal.
