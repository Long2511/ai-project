The fact that the patient's husband has recently died of a similar severe febrile illness should raise the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been associated with mines.

The patient should be treated with extreme caution because of the possibility of a viral haemorrhagic fever. Nosocomial spread of these diseases can cause hospital outbreaks with a high case fatality rate. The patient should ideally be isolated in a side room. Blood tests should be kept to a minimum to reduce the risk to laboratory staff. Protective clothing, such as gloves and a surgical gown, are recommended during proce-dures. The risk of transmission of VHF viruses from a malaria slide is very low once the blood spot is dry; therefore it would be reasonable to do a malaria slide or a rapid diag-nostic test. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium falci-parum parasitaemia in Uganda is high and a positive slide would not rule out VHF.
