To protect laboratory staff all biochemical and haemato logical tests should be done using near-patient testing if possible.

The public health authorities should be alerted to the pos sibility of a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Ideally testing for this should be organized, but samples are likely to need spe cial shipping arrangements to be taken to a specialized laboratory.

A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falci parum. A sample for Marburg and Ebola PCR was sent in a sealed plastic container. The patient was isolated in a side room and all patient contact was carried out while wearing gloves. She was treated with IV artesunate and then arte mether/lumefantrine. She was given empirical IV ceftriaxone to cover for possible sepsis and was resuscitated with IV fluids.
