A young Ugandan woman presents to a rural hospital with a severe febrile illness. She is hypotensive and has bilateral con-junctivitis. Her husband has recently died after a short febrile illness.

The presentation is non-specific and a wide range of acute infectious diseases are possible.

Both malaria and typhoid fever present with non-specific symptoms and a septic picture, but neither would cause con-junctivitis. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, including inva-sive meningococcal disease have to be considered.

A severe viral infection with an adenovirus or influenza would be possible but the patient appears slightly too unwell for this. Measles commonly presents with pronounced con-junctivitis, but at this stage one would see a rash. Zika virus was discovered in Uganda and presents with conjunctivitis, but usually is a mild viral illness and does not cause shock.
