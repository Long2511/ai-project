Over the next few days the patient remained very unwell, then she started to improve. Once she had recovered, she was kept in isolation for an additional 2 days and was then allowed to return home. The day after her discharge a positive Marburg virus PCR result came back. Had this been known while she was in the hospital, stricter infection con trol procedures, including double gloves, a mask, goggles and a disposable (waterproof) surgical gown, would have been appropriate.

Her family members, close friends and medical staff were interviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her, or her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for 21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum incubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever or became unwell during this period was isolated.
