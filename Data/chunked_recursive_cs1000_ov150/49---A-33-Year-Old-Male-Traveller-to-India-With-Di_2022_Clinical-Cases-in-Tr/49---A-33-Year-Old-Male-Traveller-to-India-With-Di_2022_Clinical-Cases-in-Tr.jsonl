He reports weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence and abdominal cramping when passing stool. For the past 3 days he has had bloating and distension after intake of milk products with an urge to pass stool. He has mild nausea, but no fever. Stools were watery earlier but he went to a local pharmacy and was given ciprofloxacin, which he took for 5 days ending 2 days previously, and stools are now three or four per day, mushy, greasy and foul-smelling.\n\nA 33-year-old man, 180 cm, 72 kg (reports a 4 kg weight loss), mild non-specific abdominal tenderness. No signs of dehydration. The rest of the examination is normal."}

Few, bulky, or large watery stools indicate small bowel secretory pathophysiology, with possible causes including Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Giardia, and possibly Shigella. Large volume, watery diarrhoea is linked to enterotoxin-mediated small bowel issues, potentially caused by Vibrio cholerae, ETEC, or Cryptosporidium. Many small-volume stools point to large bowel involvement, with possible agents being Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, and Entamoeba histolytica. Tenesmus, faecal urgency, or dysentery suggest colitis, which can be caused by E. histolytica, enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Shigella, Campylobacter, Y. enterocolitica, or Clostridioides difficile"}

Vomiting associated with diarrhoea suggests gastroenteritis or is toxin-mediated, with causes like Noroviruses, rotavirus in children, Bacillus cereus, or Staphylococcus aureus from food poisoning. Fever associated with diarrhoea points to mucosal invasion or is seen in children, caused by agents such as E. histolytica, EIEC, EHEC, Shigella, Salmonella, C. difficile, Campylobacter, or viral agents. Persistent diarrhoea for over two weeks indicates secondary malabsorption or invasion and can be caused by Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, or Aeromonas, and in cases of immunosuppression, by Cystoisospora belli, Cryptosporidium, or Microsporidium.

Fat malabsorption can be caused by Giardia lamblia/intestinalis. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome may be caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or Shigella dysenteriae. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a complication caused by Campylobacter jejuni. Reactive arthritis and Erythema nodosum can both be caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia species. Enteritis necroticans is caused by Clostridium perfringens type C. Liver abscess and other forms of extraintestinal amoebiasis are caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Finally, chronic fatigue syndrome is a complication from Giardia lamblia/intestinalis, particularly as described from Scandinavia."}

On review, he stated that his stool consistency had returned to normal and the frequency had decreased, he had no nausea and his anorexia had decreased. He had eaten a local dessert the previous day without realizing that it was made of reduced milk and had experienced some bloating and dis-comfort, but was otherwise feeling much better.\n\nGiardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia), a flagellate protozoan.

The trophozoites produce an environmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool and enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel movements. The most common method of infection is by drinking contaminated water. However, people may also become infected through hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and unknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of giardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symptoms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps, gas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The symptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer"}

Giardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, fat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients. Malabsorption can sometimes be prolonged and take several weeks to disappear. Chronic and multiple infections in young children have been shown to cause long-term effects on growth leading to stunting. The most common treatment is administration of drugs of the nitroimidazole group, with tinidazole being the drug of choice followed by metronidazole. Tinidazole is effective as a single dose of 2 g, and metronidazole 500 mg is given tds for 5 to 7 days. Non-responsiveness to nitroimidazole treatment is increasingly seen, in particular in travellers to South Asia where rates can reach up to 50%. Other drugs used are e.g. quinacrine, nitazoxanide and furazolidone."}
