In the absence of a laboratory, clinical features sometimes provide a clue to the cause of infectious diarrhoea. Few, bulky, or large watery stools indicate small bowel secretory pathophysiology, with possible causes including Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Giardia, and possibly Shigella. Large volume, watery diarrhoea is linked to enterotoxin-mediated small bowel issues, potentially caused by Vibrio cholerae, ETEC, or Cryptosporidium. Many small-volume stools point to large bowel involvement, with possible agents being Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, and Entamoeba histolytica. Tenesmus, faecal urgency, or dysentery suggest colitis, which can be caused by E. histolytica, enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Shigella, Campylobacter, Y. enterocolitica, or Clostridioides difficile
