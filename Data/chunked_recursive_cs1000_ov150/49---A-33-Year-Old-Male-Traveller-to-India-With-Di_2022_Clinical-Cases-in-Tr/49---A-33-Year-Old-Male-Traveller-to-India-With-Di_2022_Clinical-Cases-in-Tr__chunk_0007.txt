The patient was given tinidazole 2 g as a single oral dose. He was advised to restrict milk and high sugar products for a period of 2 weeks. He was counselled on food and water safety when travelling and was asked to return after 3 days. On review, he stated that his stool consistency had returned to normal and the frequency had decreased, he had no nausea and his anorexia had decreased. He had eaten a local dessert the previous day without realizing that it was made of reduced milk and had experienced some bloating and dis-comfort, but was otherwise feeling much better.

Giardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia), a flagellate protozoan. The parasite is present throughout the world, with several species found in animals. Not all infections result in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local populations with constant exposure rarely develop disease.
