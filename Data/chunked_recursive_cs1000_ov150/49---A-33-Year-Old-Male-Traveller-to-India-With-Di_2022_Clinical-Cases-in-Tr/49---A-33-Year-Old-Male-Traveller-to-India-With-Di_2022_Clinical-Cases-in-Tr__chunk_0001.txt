A 33-year-old man from Finland who had been backpacking in India for the previous month presents to a private doctor in Chinglepet, Tamil Nadu, with complaints of passage of loose stools (four or five episodes per day) for the past 2 weeks. He reports weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence and abdominal cramping when passing stool. For the past 3 days he has had bloating and distension after intake of milk products with an urge to pass stool. He has mild nausea, but no fever. Stools were watery earlier but he went to a local pharmacy and was given ciprofloxacin, which he took for 5 days ending 2 days previously, and stools are now three or four per day, mushy, greasy and foul-smelling.

A 33-year-old man, 180 cm, 72 kg (reports a 4 kg weight loss), mild non-specific abdominal tenderness. No signs of dehydration. The rest of the examination is normal.
