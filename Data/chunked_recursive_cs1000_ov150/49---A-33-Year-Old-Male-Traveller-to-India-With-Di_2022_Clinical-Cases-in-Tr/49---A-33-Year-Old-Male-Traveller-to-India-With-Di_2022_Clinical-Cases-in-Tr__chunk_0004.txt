Vomiting associated with diarrhoea suggests gastroenteritis or is toxin-mediated, with causes like Noroviruses, rotavirus in children, Bacillus cereus, or Staphylococcus aureus from food poisoning. Fever associated with diarrhoea points to mucosal invasion or is seen in children, caused by agents such as E. histolytica, EIEC, EHEC, Shigella, Salmonella, C. difficile, Campylobacter, or viral agents. Persistent diarrhoea for over two weeks indicates secondary malabsorption or invasion and can be caused by Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, or Aeromonas, and in cases of immunosuppression, by Cystoisospora belli, Cryptosporidium, or Microsporidium. Diarrhoea caused by small intestinal infection is typically high volume, watery and often associated with malabsorption and dehydration
