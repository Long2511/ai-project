Chronic diarrhoea or recurrent episodes of acute diarrhoea should prompt HIV testing.

Common complications of acute enteric infections include carbohydrate intolerance or malabsorption, which can be caused by Giardia lamblia/intestinalis, rotavirus, and other forms of viral gastroenteritis. Fat malabsorption can be caused by Giardia lamblia/intestinalis. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome may be caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or Shigella dysenteriae. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a complication caused by Campylobacter jejuni. Reactive arthritis and Erythema nodosum can both be caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia species. Enteritis necroticans is caused by Clostridium perfringens type C. Liver abscess and other forms of extraintestinal amoebiasis are caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Finally, chronic fatigue syndrome is a complication from Giardia lamblia/intestinalis, particularly as described from Scandinavia.
