Giardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of humans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause diarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and possibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an environmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool and enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel movements. The most common method of infection is by drinking contaminated water. However, people may also become infected through hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and unknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of giardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symptoms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps, gas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The symptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer
