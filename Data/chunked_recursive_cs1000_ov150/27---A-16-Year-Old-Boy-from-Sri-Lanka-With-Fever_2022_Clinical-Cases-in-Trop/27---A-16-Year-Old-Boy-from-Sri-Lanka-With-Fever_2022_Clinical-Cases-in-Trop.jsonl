He has vomited two to three times during the illness and has not passed any urine for the previous 12 hours. He does not have a cough, coryza or shortness of breath. He has been attending school until his illness. He had been fishing in an urban water stream 5 days before falling ill."}

Temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), the pulse rate is 100 bpm (low in volume). The blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg.\nThere is no neck stiffness, however there is severe muscle tenderness, mainly involving the abdominal wall and the calves such that the patient finds it difficult to walk. There is no lymphadenopathy. The cardiac apex is not shifted and heart sounds are clear. Examination of the lungs is normal. The liver is palpable at 4cm below the right costal margin and is tender. The spleen is not palpable. There is mild bilateral renal angle tenderness. Neurological examination is normal."}

The platelet count was low at 96 x 10^9/L. Liver function tests were abnormal, showing elevated AST at 64 IU/L, ALT at 58 IU/L, and ALP at 246 IU/L. Bilirubin was high, with total serum bilirubin at 77 µmol/L and direct serum bilirubin at 54.7 µmol/L. Renal function was impaired, with blood urea nitrogen at 20.7 µmol/L and serum creatinine at 212.2 µmol/L. The C-reactive protein level was also elevated at 48 mg/L.\n\nThe urine microscopy shows 20 red blood cells per high-power field, proteins '+' and granular casts '+'. A chest radiograph is normal. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia."}

It may present with an acute onset of fever, hepatomegaly and renal failure. There usually is lymphadenopathy; and on careful examination, one may spot an eschar. Subconjunctival haemorrhage has been described but is less common than in leptospirosis, and complications such as renal failure tend to occur late in the infection (after about 7 days).\nHantavirus infection may cause a haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. It has a similar epidemiology to leptospirosis and is also associated with contact with rodent excreta."}

However, dark-field microscopy is of poor sensitivity and specificity and only yields positive results during the early bacteraemic phase of the disease.\nLeptospira may be cultured from blood, CSF or urine. Isolation of the bacteria from blood or CSF is only possible during the first week of illness. Samples have to be incubated for at least 8 weeks and analysed weekly with a dark-field microscope. This technique is laborious and not routine practice in a standard microbiological laboratory."}

PCR performance varies between types of samples taken and depends on the time the sample was taken in relation to duration of illness. Sensitivity and specificity appear to be higher in urine than in blood and are better in blood samples taken early rather than later during the course of illness.\nFor indirect diagnosis, the historical reference serological test is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). MAT relies on incubation of patient serum with Leptospira antigen suspension and determines agglutination with a dark-field microscope. This method requires a high level of expertise and is limited to expert centres.\nThe MAT cannot differentiate between current or past infections. Therefore two consecutive serum samples should be examined to look for seroconversion or at least a fourfold rise in titre. The significance of titres in single serum specimens is a matter of debate."}

It appears that sensitivity of these tests is highly variable if blood is examined during week one of the illness, it improves (75% and 100%) if blood is taken after day 7. A positive IgM ELISA should be confirmed by MAT."}

It is caused by pathogenic Leptospira species, which belong to the spirochaetes. The most common species causing disease in humans and animals are L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii.\nHumans become infected through direct contact with urine of infected mammalian hosts, contact with contaminated water or animal abortion products. The major reservoirs are rodents, canines, livestock and wild mammals. Most at risk are slum dwellers and people with an occupational or recreational exposure involving animal contact or immersion in water. Also, natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods may put people at risk.\nThe bacteria enter the human body through cuts or abrasions of the skin or through intact mucous membranes. The incubation period is 2 to 30 days. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to severe infection."}

The initial leptospiraemic phase usually starts abruptly. Symptoms are non-specific with fever, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain and a rash. Severe myalgias, most notably of the calves and the lumbar area, and subconjunctival haemorrhage have been mentioned as distinguishing physical findings. This first phase lasts for a week and is followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology.\nFive to ten per cent of those with clinical infection will develop severe leptospirosis with cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury and haemorrhagic diathesis (Weil's syndrome). Further complications include pulmonary involvement, aseptic meningitis and myocarditis."}

Alternatives include amoxicillin and azithromycin. In severe infection benzylpenicillin, IV doxycycline, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime seem to have similar efficacy. Doxycycline 200 mg weekly has been suggested as exposure prophylaxis."}
