Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection has been used on blood, CSF and urine. PCR performance varies between types of samples taken and depends on the time the sample was taken in relation to duration of illness. Sensitivity and specificity appear to be higher in urine than in blood and are better in blood samples taken early rather than later during the course of illness.
For indirect diagnosis, the historical reference serological test is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). MAT relies on incubation of patient serum with Leptospira antigen suspension and determines agglutination with a dark-field microscope. This method requires a high level of expertise and is limited to expert centres.
The MAT cannot differentiate between current or past infections. Therefore two consecutive serum samples should be examined to look for seroconversion or at least a fourfold rise in titre. The significance of titres in single serum specimens is a matter of debate.
