An acute febrile illness accompanied by jaundice, renal failure and subconjunctival haemorrhage should raise the suspicion of leptospirosis, particularly in case of a history involving exposure to potentially contaminated water.
Scrub typhus is another very common infection in South Asia. It may present with an acute onset of fever, hepatomegaly and renal failure. There usually is lymphadenopathy; and on careful examination, one may spot an eschar. Subconjunctival haemorrhage has been described but is less common than in leptospirosis, and complications such as renal failure tend to occur late in the infection (after about 7 days).
Hantavirus infection may cause a haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. It has a similar epidemiology to leptospirosis and is also associated with contact with rodent excreta.
