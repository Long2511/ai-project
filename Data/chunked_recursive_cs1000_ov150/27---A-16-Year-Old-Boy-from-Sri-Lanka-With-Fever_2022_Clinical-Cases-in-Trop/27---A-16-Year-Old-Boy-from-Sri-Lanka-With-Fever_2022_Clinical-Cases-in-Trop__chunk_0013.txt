Leptospirosis is usually treated with antibiotics, although the usefulness of antibiotic treatment in particular during the second phase of illness, which is immune-mediated, has been disputed.
For uncomplicated cases, oral doxycycline is the drug of choice. Alternatives include amoxicillin and azithromycin. In severe infection benzylpenicillin, IV doxycycline, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime seem to have similar efficacy. Doxycycline 200 mg weekly has been suggested as exposure prophylaxis.
