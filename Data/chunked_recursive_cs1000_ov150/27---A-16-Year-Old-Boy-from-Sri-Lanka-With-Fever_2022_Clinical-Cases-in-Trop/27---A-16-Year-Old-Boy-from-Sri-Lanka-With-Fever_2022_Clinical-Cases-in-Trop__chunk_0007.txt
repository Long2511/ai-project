The microscopic diagnosis of leptospirosis requires a darkfield or a phase-contrast microscope because the bacteria stain poorly. However, dark-field microscopy is of poor sensitivity and specificity and only yields positive results during the early bacteraemic phase of the disease.
Leptospira may be cultured from blood, CSF or urine. Isolation of the bacteria from blood or CSF is only possible during the first week of illness. Samples have to be incubated for at least 8 weeks and analysed weekly with a dark-field microscope. This technique is laborious and not routine practice in a standard microbiological laboratory.
