Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs worldwide. It is caused by pathogenic Leptospira species, which belong to the spirochaetes. The most common species causing disease in humans and animals are L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii.
Humans become infected through direct contact with urine of infected mammalian hosts, contact with contaminated water or animal abortion products. The major reservoirs are rodents, canines, livestock and wild mammals. Most at risk are slum dwellers and people with an occupational or recreational exposure involving animal contact or immersion in water. Also, natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods may put people at risk.
The bacteria enter the human body through cuts or abrasions of the skin or through intact mucous membranes. The incubation period is 2 to 30 days. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to severe infection.
