The classical presentation of leptospirosis is that of a biphasic illness. The initial leptospiraemic phase usually starts abruptly. Symptoms are non-specific with fever, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain and a rash. Severe myalgias, most notably of the calves and the lumbar area, and subconjunctival haemorrhage have been mentioned as distinguishing physical findings. This first phase lasts for a week and is followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology.
Five to ten per cent of those with clinical infection will develop severe leptospirosis with cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury and haemorrhagic diathesis (Weil's syndrome). Further complications include pulmonary involvement, aseptic meningitis and myocarditis.
