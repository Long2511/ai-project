She has just returned from a 6-week trip to Ghana.\nThe swelling has developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. It is itchy, but not painful. There is no history of fever; no history of arthropod bites. The patient is otherwise fine.\n\nThere is localized swelling on the left leg, about 1.5cm in diameter. The skin surrounding the swelling is slightly hyperaemic. The boil is covered by a blackish scab. There is no lymphadenopathy. The patient is afebrile while the rest of the physical examination is normal.\n\nWhat are your most important differential diagnoses?\nHow would you approach this patient?\n\nA young traveller presents with a localized swelling on her leg after backpacking in Ghana. The swelling has been growing slowly and there are no systemic signs or symptoms."}

This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process.\nSpider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.\nLocalized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles or abscesses are very common among backpacking travellers. A hot and humid tropical climate combined with low standards of hygiene favour bacterial and fungal skin infections. Itchy mosquito bites may serve as a portal of entry. Bacterial spread often occurs via scratching or contaminated items such as towels and shavers."}

The slow growth of the boil, the absence of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms as well as the localized itch make myiasis the most likely differential diagnosis."}

Using a magnifying glass, one could see that the matter was not a pustular head but appeared to be pulsating and oozing transparent fluid. This appearance is typical of myiasis – the pulsating end of the larva seen contains the respiratory spiracles.\nThe lesion was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned 2 days later for review.\nThe maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with a pair of forceps. The remaining lesion looked clean and no further treatment was required."}
{"id": "8---A-26-Year-Old-Female-Traveller-Returning-from_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro__0005", "text": "In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans become infected when lying on the ground or wearing contaminated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow into the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing larvae cause an itchy and at times painful 'blind boil.' Lesions are usually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in the larvae's guts."}
{"id": "8---A-26-Year-Old-Female-Traveller-Returning-from_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro__0006", "text": "Treatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which prompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion to block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best left to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve, and maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and superinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-limiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and pupate elsewhere.\nIn Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Dermatobia hominis, the human botfly. Unlike the Tumbu fly, this species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called 'hitch-hiking.'\nRemoval of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision."}

Wounds can be infested as well."}

It derives from the Greek word “myia” which means “fly.” Cutaneous furuncular myiasis is one of the most common travel-associated skin disorders."}
