There is a localized swelling with a central scab. This lesion may look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms renders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation suggests a topical process.
Spider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central necrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow growth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential unlikely.
Localized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles or abscesses are very common among backpacking travellers. A hot and humid tropical climate combined with low standards of hygiene favour bacterial and fungal skin infections. Itchy mosquito bites may serve as a portal of entry. Bacterial spread often occurs via scratching or contaminated items such as towels and shavers.
