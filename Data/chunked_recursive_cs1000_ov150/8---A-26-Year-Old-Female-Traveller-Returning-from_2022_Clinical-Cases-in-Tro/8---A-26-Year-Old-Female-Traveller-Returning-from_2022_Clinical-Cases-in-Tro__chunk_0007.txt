Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision.
Additional forms of myiasis exist whereby larvae may invade various body cavities such as nasal sinuses, ears, mouth, eye, vagina or anus (body cavity myiasis). Wounds can be infested as well.
