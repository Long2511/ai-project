Myiasis is the infestation of live humans and vertebrate animals with larvae (maggots) of flies, which feed on the host's dead or living tissue, liquid body-substance or ingested food. It derives from the Greek word “myia” which means “fly.” Cutaneous furuncular myiasis is one of the most common travel-associated skin disorders.
