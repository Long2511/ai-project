In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango fly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy ground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on a clothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans become infected when lying on the ground or wearing contaminated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow into the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing larvae cause an itchy and at times painful 'blind boil.' Lesions are usually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in the larvae's guts.
