Treatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which prompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by applying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion to block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best left to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve, and maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and superinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-limiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and pupate elsewhere.
In Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Dermatobia hominis, the human botfly. Unlike the Tumbu fly, this species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it deposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, flies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a technique called 'hitch-hiking.'
Removal of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of their shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and cruciate incision.
