Gently remove the scab and take a closer look at the lesion using a magnifying glass.

The scab was removed and a whitish matter was detected underneath. Using a magnifying glass, one could see that the matter was not a pustular head but appeared to be pulsating and oozing transparent fluid. This appearance is typical of myiasis – the pulsating end of the larva seen contains the respiratory spiracles.
The lesion was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned 2 days later for review.
The maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with a pair of forceps. The remaining lesion looked clean and no further treatment was required.
