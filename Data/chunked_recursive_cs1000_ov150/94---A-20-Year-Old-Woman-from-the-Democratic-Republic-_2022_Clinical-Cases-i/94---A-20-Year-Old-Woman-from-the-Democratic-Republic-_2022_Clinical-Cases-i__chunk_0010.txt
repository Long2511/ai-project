Although considerably less infective than smallpox, monkeypox can also spread from human to human through the respiratory route or by contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. Transmission is believed to occur through saliva and respiratory secretions or contact with exudate or crust material from the skin lesions. Risk factors for transmission include sharing a bed or room or using the same utensils as an infected person.
The clinical picture of monkeypox is similar to smallpox but shows a considerably milder course with a case fatality rate of <10%. It is believed that the rising number of reported human cases in recent years is largely attributable to the waning herd immunity after the suspension of smallpox vaccination in the early 1980s.
