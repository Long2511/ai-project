A 20-year-old woman presents to her local hospital in a rural area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, swelling of the neck and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after the symptoms began. The skin lesions first appeared on the face and then spread centrifugally over her body, including the palms and soles of her feet as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions have developed from initial macules to papules, then to vesicles and finally to pustules. The oral mucosal lesions are painful and make drinking and eating difficult.
The patient resides in a village, where people live from agriculture, she has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children.
