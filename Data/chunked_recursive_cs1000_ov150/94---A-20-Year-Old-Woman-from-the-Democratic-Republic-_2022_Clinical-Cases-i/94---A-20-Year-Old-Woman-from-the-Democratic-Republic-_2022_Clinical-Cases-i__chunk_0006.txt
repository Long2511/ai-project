Comparing viral infections with a vesicular rash, the incubation period is 6-16 days for monkeypox, 12-14 days for smallpox, 7-14 days for cowpox, and 14-17 days for varicella. Fever in monkeypox ranges from 38.5 to 40.5°C, while in smallpox it is over 40°C. Fever is rare in cowpox and under 38.8°C in varicella. The rash is disseminated and uniform in both monkeypox and smallpox; in cowpox, it is typically a localized singular lesion, though rarely disseminated, and in varicella, the rash is disseminated and non-uniform. The lesion distribution is centrifugal for monkeypox and smallpox, and centripetal for varicella. Regarding lesion progression, both monkeypox and smallpox feature a homogenous rash where lesions are mostly in one stage of development with slow progression, each stage lasting 1-2 days. In contrast, varicella has a heterogeneous rash with lesions often in multiple stages of development and fast progression
