. In contrast, varicella has a heterogeneous rash with lesions often in multiple stages of development and fast progression. Lesions on the palms or soles are common in monkeypox and smallpox, but rare in varicella. The rash period from appearance to desquamation is 14-21 days for monkeypox, 14-21 days for smallpox, 21-56 days for cowpox, and 10-21 days for varicella.
