The clinical manifestation suggests a viral infection and the morphology and evolution of the skin lesions is characteristic for a poxvirus. Although smallpox was eradicated in 1979 and no cases have occurred since, a zoonotic poxvirus would be the primary suspicion, particularly monkeypox, which is endemic in rural regions of Central Africa. Varicella, caused by the varicella zoster virus, is another febrile illness associated with a vesicular rash that is often confused with monkeypox, but several features help distinguish the two illnesses (discussed below).
Cowpox usually presents with a single lesion (unless the patient is immunosuppressed); fever and lymphadenopathy are uncommon, therefore this seems to be less likely.

Important criteria to distinguish the main viral infections presenting with a vesiculopapular rash include the distribution of the skin lesions, the stage of the respective lesion(s), involvement of palms and soles, and the presence of fever and lymphadenopathy.
