Human monkeypox is a sporadic smallpox-like zoonotic viral exanthematous disease. It occurs in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. The virus was first identified in 1958 in laboratory monkeys. Human monkeypox was not recognized as a distinct infection in humans until 1970. Then, during efforts to eradicate smallpox, the virus was isolated from a patient with suspected smallpox infection in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Although the natural animal reservoir of monkeypox remains unknown, several lines of evidence point to rodents as a likely reservoir. The sporadically observed human cases and small outbreaks are confined to remote villages and believed to result from close contact between humans and wild animals. However, the precise exposure is often difficult to pinpoint in areas where contact with animals through household rodent infestations and hunting or preparation of bushmeat from a variety of species is common
