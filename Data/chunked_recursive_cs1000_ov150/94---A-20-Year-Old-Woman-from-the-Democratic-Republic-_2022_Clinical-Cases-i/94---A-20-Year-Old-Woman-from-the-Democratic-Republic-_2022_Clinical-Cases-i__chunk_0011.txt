In endemic regions, the fairly distinct rash of monkeypox is primarily a clinical diagnosis because neither commercial assays nor the required laboratory infrastructure are usually readily available. The definitive diagnosis is established by PCR, culture, immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy but demands biosafety level 2 laboratory facilities. Optimal diagnostic specimens for PCR are lesion exudate on a swab or crust specimens (stored in a dry, sterile tube without any transport media and kept cold). Interpretation of serological tests can be hampered by cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses including previous smallpox vaccination.
