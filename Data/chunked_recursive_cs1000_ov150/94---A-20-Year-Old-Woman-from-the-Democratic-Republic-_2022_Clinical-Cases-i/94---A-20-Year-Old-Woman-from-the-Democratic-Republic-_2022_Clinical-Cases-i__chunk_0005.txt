Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment for monkeypox is available and clinical management is exclusively supportive. Persons who have been vaccinated against smallpox in the past appear to have some cross-protection against monkeypox; and if they get infected, develop milder symptoms than unvaccinated persons. Our patient is 20 years old, and was thus born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programmes were stopped in the early 1980s. She made an uneventful recovery; however, with scarring from the skin lesions.
