KS is an incurable HIV-associated malignancy. The incidence of KS is on the decline globally as a result of prevention of disease because of early initiation of ART. KS is caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). KS commonly affects the skin but may also involve lymph nodes, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance though biopsy is recommended.
