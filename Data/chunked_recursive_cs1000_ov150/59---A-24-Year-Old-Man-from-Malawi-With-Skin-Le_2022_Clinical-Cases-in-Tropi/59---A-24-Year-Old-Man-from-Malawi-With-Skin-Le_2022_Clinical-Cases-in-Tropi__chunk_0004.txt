The main concern of the patient and primary caregiver should be recorded to assist with prioritizing interventions that promote quality of life. These concerns may be physical, psychological, social or spiritual. General positive living advice, including safe sexual practice, screening for STIs and partner(s) and children testing for HIV, may also be addressed. The diagnosis should be explained to the patient in a style and language which is supportive and understandable. The practitioner should allow time for questions and exploration of relevant issues, which can assist with planning. Such communication can facilitate the development of realistic expectations from the start of the therapeutic process.
