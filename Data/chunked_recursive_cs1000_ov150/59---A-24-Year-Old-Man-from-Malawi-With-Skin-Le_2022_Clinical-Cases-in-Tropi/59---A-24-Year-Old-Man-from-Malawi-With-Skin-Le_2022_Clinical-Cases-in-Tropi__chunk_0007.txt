Endemic KS does occur in HIV-uninfected individuals, typically with a more indolent course. All HIV infected patients with KS should be started on ART. For those with more extensive cutaneous disease or visceral involvement, combining antiretroviral medication with chemotherapeutic agents promotes optimal tumour regression. Agents such as liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, bleomycin, vincristine, vinblastine and etoposide can be considered. Drug availability, access to safe chemotherapy administration, contraindications and side effects of particular agents should be considered with reference to the patient and the setting. Tumour response to immunomodulating agents has been demonstrated in a small study in the USA. Outcomes remain poor for patients with extensive visceral disease (AIDS Clinical Trials Group stage T1)
