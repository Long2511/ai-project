In a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient with a chronic history of cough, the diagnosis of tuberculosis should always be considered and vigorous attempts made to exclude it. The skin lesions are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The presence of palatal lesions supports this possibility and increases your suspicion of pulmonary involvement.

The patient should be assessed for possible pulmonary tuberculosis, which should include a urine LAM, sputum microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), Xpert MTB/RIF and chest radiograph where necessary. Where available, bronchoscopy remains the gold standard investigation for endobronchial KS. Dual pathology of pulmonary KS and TB is not uncommon, and a high index of suspicion for TB should be maintained, particularly as TB remains responsible for many HIV-related deaths.
