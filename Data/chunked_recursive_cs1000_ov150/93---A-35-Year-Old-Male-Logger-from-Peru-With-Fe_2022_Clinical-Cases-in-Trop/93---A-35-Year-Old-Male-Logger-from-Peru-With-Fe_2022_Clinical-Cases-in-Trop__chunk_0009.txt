Yellow fever is and arboviral infection caused by a flavivirus and transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. It is endemic in South and Central America and in Africa. There is no yellow fever in Asia.

The incubation period of yellow fever is usually 3 to 6 days. Most cases are subclinical or show mild and non-specific symptoms. After an acute febrile illness with headache and myalgia without a rash that likely represents the peak viraemia, there may be a period of remission, as seen in other flaviviral infections. Fever may then resume joined by back pain, nausea, vomiting and altered mental status progressing to the severe clinical syndrome described above. Haematemesis is commonly described. In fatal cases, death usually occurs 7 to 10 days into the illness.
