As with other flaviviruses there is no specific treatment for yellow fever, making prevention by use of the 17D live yellow fever vaccine imperative. Vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent persons is at nearly 100%. While most individuals in endemic areas (Amazon basin and sub-Saharan Africa) have poor access to vaccines and there are regular shortages during yellow fever epidemics there is dramatic under-use of the vaccination by travellers and expatriates. Data indicates that the number of unvaccinated travellers visiting risk areas is substantial. Each year, deaths in unvaccinated travellers to yellow fever endemic areas are reported.
