If available, PCR of urine and blood should be done to look for leptospirosis; microscopic agglutination test is an alternative if PCR is not available.

Laboratory tests should include IgM antibodies for the different viral hepatitis viruses (except for acute hepatitis D because of delayed antibody production).

IgM antibodies against the yellow fever virus persist for several weeks and can be detected by various methods, e.g. IgM capture ELISA. Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR could also be attempted.
