Eight days prior, he developed fever and retro-orbital headache. Two days into the illness he was admitted to a local hospital in the jungle after he had developed jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria and increasing mental obtundation. During the transfer to the referral hospital in Lima the patient had a generalized seizure. His past medical history included hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years before.\n\nThe patient was born in Lima, but for the past 5 years has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River (which joins the Marañón to form the Amazon river). He has not taken any malaria prophylaxis and has not received any vaccinations since his early childhood."}

He is agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands and intermittently stuporous. There is marked flapping of hands, no focal neurological signs and no meningeal signs. He is jaundiced, and there is spontaneous bleeding of his oral mucosa and at venipuncture and IV sites. There are multiple large ecchymoses on the face, the trunk and all limbs. On auscultation of the lungs there are crepitant rales in both bases. The heart sounds are normal. The liver is felt 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen is not palpable and there is no lymphadenopathy."}

The white cell count was 8700/μL, within the normal range of 4500-11000/μL. The differential count was also within normal limits, showing 4% bands, 62% neutrophils, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 6% monocytes, and 28% lymphocytes. The platelet count was low at 110000/μL, below the reference of 150000-450000/μL. Liver enzymes were severely elevated, with AST at 2890 U/L and ALT at 2676 U/L, far exceeding the normal range of 0-35 U/L. Alkaline phosphatase was 496 U/L, well above the reference of 38-126 U/L. Bilirubin levels were high, with total bilirubin at 11.6 mg/dL and direct bilirubin at 9.2 mg/dL, compared to reference ranges of 0.3-1.2 mg/dL and 0-0.4 mg/dL respectively. Renal function tests showed an elevated urea of 89 mg/dL compared to the reference range of 17-49 mg/dL, while the creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL was at the upper limit of its normal range.

Brucella serology is negative. Hepatitis B IgM anti-Hbc are negative.\n\nA young male Peruvian logger working in the South American jungle presents with fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy and seizures. Laboratory results indicate liver failure.\n\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure. Severe malaria is a possibility, although transaminases are usually not so high. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E) and toxin-mediated hepatitis.\n\nLeptospirosis seems possible, but the transaminases in leptospirosis are usually only mildly elevated (less than 200 U/L) and jaundice is caused by cholestasis rather than hepatocellular damage. Typhoid fever and brucellosis are other bacterial infections to be taken into account."}

Also, haematocrit would be increased rather than low, as in this case.\n\nOther viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) with jaundice are possible, particularly given his occupation as a logger in the Peruvian jungle with possible contact to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. The most prominent VHF in Peru is yellow fever and he does not appear to be vaccinated against this disease.\n\nSerial thick blood smears for malaria should be ordered.\n\nDengue NS1 and dengue IgM should be performed (because NS1 might have turned negative after more than 1 week of illness).\n\nBlood cultures should be done to look for Brucella species, as well as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi. If brucellosis is suspected, microbiologists must be informed because specimens have to be handled under special biosafety precautions to prevent laboratory infections."}

Over the next 3 days, he developed increasing hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, coma, and DIC with increasing spontaneous bleeding. The chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Repeat laboratory results on day 3 showed deterioration of his kidney function (creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL) and a sudden drop in his liver transaminases (AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L), most likely indicating acute hepatic disintegration. Sadly, the patient passed away 1 day later.\n\nIgM capture ELISA for yellow fever came back highly positive at 1:10000. Anti-dengue IgM was negative. Direct viral isolation in culture was negative on a blood specimen drawn on admission (8 days into the illness), which is not surprising because viraemia in yellow fever is short (4–5 days). Permission for autopsy was refused, therefore liver histology was not available."}

It is endemic in South and Central America and in Africa. There is no yellow fever in Asia.\n\nThe incubation period of yellow fever is usually 3 to 6 days. Most cases are subclinical or show mild and non-specific symptoms. After an acute febrile illness with headache and myalgia without a rash that likely represents the peak viraemia, there may be a period of remission, as seen in other flaviviral infections. Fever may then resume joined by back pain, nausea, vomiting and altered mental status progressing to the severe clinical syndrome described above. Haematemesis is commonly described. In fatal cases, death usually occurs 7 to 10 days into the illness."}

Vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent persons is at nearly 100%. While most individuals in endemic areas (Amazon basin and sub-Saharan Africa) have poor access to vaccines and there are regular shortages during yellow fever epidemics there is dramatic under-use of the vaccination by travellers and expatriates. Data indicates that the number of unvaccinated travellers visiting risk areas is substantial. Each year, deaths in unvaccinated travellers to yellow fever endemic areas are reported."}
