His malaria thick film is three times negative. Blood cultures are negative. Brucella serology is negative. Hepatitis B IgM anti-Hbc are negative.

A young male Peruvian logger working in the South American jungle presents with fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy and seizures. Laboratory results indicate liver failure.

This patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure. Severe malaria is a possibility, although transaminases are usually not so high. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E) and toxin-mediated hepatitis.

Leptospirosis seems possible, but the transaminases in leptospirosis are usually only mildly elevated (less than 200 U/L) and jaundice is caused by cholestasis rather than hepatocellular damage. Typhoid fever and brucellosis are other bacterial infections to be taken into account.
