Severe dengue has to be considered, although 8 days of fever appears long for dengue and usually jaundice is not so prominent. Also, haematocrit would be increased rather than low, as in this case.

Other viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) with jaundice are possible, particularly given his occupation as a logger in the Peruvian jungle with possible contact to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. The most prominent VHF in Peru is yellow fever and he does not appear to be vaccinated against this disease.

Serial thick blood smears for malaria should be ordered.

Dengue NS1 and dengue IgM should be performed (because NS1 might have turned negative after more than 1 week of illness).

Blood cultures should be done to look for Brucella species, as well as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi. If brucellosis is suspected, microbiologists must be informed because specimens have to be handled under special biosafety precautions to prevent laboratory infections.
