The diagnostic principles for most alphaviruses are the same: During the first days of the acute infection, detection of viral RNA in the blood by PCR may confirm the diagnosis. Beyond the acute phase, the diagnosis is based upon serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the respective virus. Cross-reactivity within the same virus family is common. Reference laboratories therefore usually perform parallel testing for potentially cross-reacting viruses and apply a two-step approach, using highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.

Given the patient's travel history, the course of the illness and the clinical signs and symptoms experienced during the journey, Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection was strongly suspected. (Chikungunya was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time this patient was seen).
