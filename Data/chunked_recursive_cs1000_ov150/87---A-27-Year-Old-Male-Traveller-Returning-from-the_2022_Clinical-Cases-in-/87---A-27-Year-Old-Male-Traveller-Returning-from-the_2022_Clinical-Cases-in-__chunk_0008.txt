Chikungunya, found in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, appears in large sporadic epidemics. Common symptoms include fever in 90% of cases, rash in 40-50%, myalgia in 90%, and arthralgia or arthritis in over 95% of cases. The Sindbis Virus Group is the most geographically widespread alphavirus, present in Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and Oceania, though human case data is lacking. It is primarily known from reports in West Russia ("Karelian fever"), Finland ("Pogosta disease"), and Sweden ("Ockelbo disease"). Karelian fever is rare, Pogosta disease reports around 140 cases annually, and Ockelbo disease reports about 30 cases per year. Its symptoms include fever in 15-40% of cases, rash in 90%, myalgia in 50%, and arthralgia or arthritis in 95%. Ross River virus, endemic to Australia, Papua New Guinea, and West Papua, causes around 5,000 cases annually in Australia. A major epidemic in 1979-1980 affected over 60,000 people on several Pacific islands
