Mayaro-virus is an alphavirus. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that circulate among a wide variety of wild animals in relative mosquito vector-specific and host-specific enzootic cycles; infection of humans (dead-end hosts) is exclusively incidental. The Mayaro virus (MAYV) circulates in an enzootic, sylvatic cycle (similar to that for yellow fever) involving forest-dwelling Haemagogus species mosquitoes as vectors and non-human primates as natural hosts. Infections in humans mostly occur sporadically, are strongly associated with occupational or recreational exposure in rainforest environments and represent spillover from the enzootic cycle. MAYV has so far been only reported from South America and the Caribbean.
