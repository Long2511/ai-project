Mayaro infection presents as a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3 to 7 days. It typically manifests with chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a maculopapular rash (sometimes followed by desquamation). Haemorrhagic manifestations have been described but are rare. Like other alphaviruses, Mayaro may cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. Treatment is exclusively symptomatic with non-steroidal drugs. Symptoms subside slowly over weeks to months. Permanent damage of the affected joints is not reported.
