Reactive arthritis is a rheumatoid factor (RF)-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often preceded by an infection. The most common triggers are gastrointestinal infections (caused by Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis). Reactive arthritis may manifest as monoarthritis (often affecting the knee or sacroiliac joint) or as oligoarthritis (usually of the lower extremities). The course may be additive (i.e. more joints becoming inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or migratory (new joints becoming inflamed after the initially inflamed joint has already improved). It usually develops within 2 to 4 weeks of the preceding infection. Reactive arthritis may also manifest with the classical triad of symptoms termed “Reiter's syndrome”: (i) inflammatory arthritis of large joints, (ii) inflammation of the eyes manifesting as conjunctivitis or uveitis and (iii) urethritis in men or cervicitis in women
