Upon return home to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient consulted his general practitioner because of persisting, incapacitating polyarthralgias. The patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility. Physical examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (swelling, redness, effusion). Laboratory tests were performed including serological testing for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi but none revealed a cause for the symptoms. For two more months, the joint pains did not improve; thus the patient was referred to a rheumatologist and subsequently to a tropical medicine clinic for evaluation of a putative travel-related cause of his polyarthralgias.
