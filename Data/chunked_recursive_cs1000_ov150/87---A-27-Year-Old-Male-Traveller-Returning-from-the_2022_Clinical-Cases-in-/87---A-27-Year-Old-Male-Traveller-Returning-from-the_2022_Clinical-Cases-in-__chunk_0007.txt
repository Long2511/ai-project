Although self-limiting polyarthralgias are present during the acute phase of many viral infections, prolonged polyarthritis/polyarthralgias are characteristic for certain viral infections. Worldwide, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella and the alphaviruses are the most common infections to consider in the differential diagnosis. Although rubella has become rare because of vaccination, the vectorborne, alphaviral infections are becoming increasingly relevant in endemic regions and in returning travellers. Unlike reactive arthritis, viral arthritis primarily presents as symmetrical polyarthritis of peripheral small joints.
