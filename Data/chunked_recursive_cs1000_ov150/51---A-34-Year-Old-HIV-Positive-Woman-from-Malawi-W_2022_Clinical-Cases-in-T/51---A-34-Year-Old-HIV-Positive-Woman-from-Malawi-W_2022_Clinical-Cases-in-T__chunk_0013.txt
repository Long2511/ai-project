PML occurring within the first months of ART is often described as PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS). Of note, PML-IRIS possibly accounts for nearly 25% of all PML cases in HIV-positive patients. Steroids might have a beneficial effect in the management of PML-IRIS. However, in a setting with high prevalence of HIV-associated opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, it is probably advisable to apply steroids only if other common CNS infections are excluded or covered for.
