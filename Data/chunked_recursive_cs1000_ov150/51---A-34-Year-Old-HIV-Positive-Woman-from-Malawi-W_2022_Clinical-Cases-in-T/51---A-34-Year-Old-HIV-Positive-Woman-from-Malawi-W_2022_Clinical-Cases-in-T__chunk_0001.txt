A 34-year-old Malawian woman presents to a neurology outpatient clinic in Malawi with slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg.

Her problems started approximately 3 months earlier when she first noticed a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed, and over the following weeks she also realized that her left arm was becoming affected.

The patient is a poor historian and often has difficulty describing the onset and timing of sequential events, but from her story it appears likely that the problems started insidiously and have been slowly progressing since. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable.
