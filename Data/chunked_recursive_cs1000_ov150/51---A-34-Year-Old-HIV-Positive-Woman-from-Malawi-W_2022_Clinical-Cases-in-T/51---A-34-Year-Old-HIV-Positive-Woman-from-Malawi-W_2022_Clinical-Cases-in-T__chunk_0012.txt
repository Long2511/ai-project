On imaging, multiple lesions are located in the subcortical white matter and cerebellar peduncles. The lesions look hypodense on CT, and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. There is no mass effect or contrast enhancement.

Besides its importance as an opportunistic infection in advanced HIV infection, PML in recent years has increasingly been described in other contexts of immunosuppression e.g. in transplant patients or patients treated with immune-modulatory drugs.

The only treatment showing benefit in PML patients with HIV is ART. Prognosis before introduction of ART was poor, and only 10% of PML patients survived for 1 year. However, in the ART era the 1-year survival rate has increased dramatically to 50%.
