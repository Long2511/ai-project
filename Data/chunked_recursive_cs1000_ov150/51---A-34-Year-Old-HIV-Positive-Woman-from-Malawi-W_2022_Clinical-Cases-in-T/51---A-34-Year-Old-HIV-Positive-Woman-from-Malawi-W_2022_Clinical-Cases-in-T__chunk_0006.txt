In this particular case, the patient developed a focal brain lesion 2 months after starting ART. Central nervous system disorders are common after ART initiation. It is thought that the recovering immune system may 'unmask' or 'paradoxically deteriorate' pre-existing CNS infections. This phenomenon is called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and, depending on the type, is termed 'unmasking' or 'paradoxical' IRIS.

Tuberculoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and cryptococcoma have been well documented in the context of IRIS. Toxoplasmosis has been described after ART initiation, even in patients on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.

Of note, our patient was diagnosed with TB at the time of ART initiation and CNS tuberculosis can deteriorate after ART introduction as well as after commencement of TB treatment.
