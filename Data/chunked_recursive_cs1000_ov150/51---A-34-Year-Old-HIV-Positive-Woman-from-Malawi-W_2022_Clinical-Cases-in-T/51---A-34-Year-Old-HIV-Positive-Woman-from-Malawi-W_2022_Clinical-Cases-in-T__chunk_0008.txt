Serum antitoxoplasma IgG and cryptococcal antigen (CrAG) are helpful, but may not be routinely available. Negative antitoxoplasma serology makes toxoplasmosis a very unlikely diagnosis, whereas a positive serological result documents past contact with the pathogen but fails to prove its relevance for the current illness.

Sensitivity of CSF examination in FBL is low, and both cryptococcoma and tuberculoma may present with a normal CSF. However, if XPert MTB/RIF or Ziehl-Neelsen stain, CrAg, India Ink or fungal cultures are available, these tests should be done and might help establish the diagnosis.

Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound are useful because they may reveal tuberculous lesions, metastases or a primary neoplasm.
