A 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presents with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness of insidious onset. She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and HIV 5 months before her presentation. She is on antiretroviral therapy (ART), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and on antituberculous medication. On examination, there is a spastic hemiparesis on the left side with sensory involvement.

The combination of spastic hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and sensory impairment affecting one half of the body localizes the lesion to her brain. The onset appears subactute and the progression is slow. This makes ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions ('strokes') unlikely causes because they present (hyper-)acutely and usually do not progress. Most likely the patient has one or several focal brain lesion(s).
