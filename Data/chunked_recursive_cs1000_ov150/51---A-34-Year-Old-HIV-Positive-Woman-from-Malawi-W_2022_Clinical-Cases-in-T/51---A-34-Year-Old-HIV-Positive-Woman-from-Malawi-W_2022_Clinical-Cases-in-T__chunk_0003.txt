The neurological examination reveals a spastic hemiparesis on the left with hyperreflexia. The power in the left leg is 2/5 (active movement with gravity eliminated) and in her left arm 3/5 (active movement against gravity). There is a pronator drift on the left indicating proximal weakness. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal.

The full blood count results showed a white blood cell count of 3.8 × 10⁹/L, against a reference range of 4–10; a haemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, against a reference range of 12–14; and a platelet count of 140 × 10⁹/L, against a reference range of 150–350.
