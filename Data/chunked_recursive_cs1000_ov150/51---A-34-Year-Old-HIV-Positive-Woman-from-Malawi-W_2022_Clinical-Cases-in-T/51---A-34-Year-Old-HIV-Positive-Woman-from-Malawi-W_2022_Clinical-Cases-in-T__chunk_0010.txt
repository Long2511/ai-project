Routine CSF examination was normal, India Ink stain and fungal cultures were negative. The patient was started on empirical antitoxoplasmosis treatment with high-dose co-trimoxazole. ART and antituberculous treatment were continued. Prednisolone 1 mg/kg bodyweight was added to cover for presumed IRIS. The patient was put on a waiting list for a cerebral MRI scan, which was available thanks to a local research project.

On 4-week follow-up her clinical status was unchanged. At 8 weeks there was further deterioration of power in her left hand. An MRI of her head was done which showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter and more prominent in the right hemisphere (frontal and temporal lobes). Furthermore, there was a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.
