A presumed diagnosis of PML was made. The patient was referred to a local rehabilitation centre for walking aids. The local palliative care team was involved.

PML is caused by a reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus. JC stands for 'John Cunningham', the first patient from whom the virus was isolated. JC polyomavirus is neurotropic, affecting oligodendrocytes.

PML always occurs as a result of virus reactivation because of immunosuppression. Primary infection usually takes place during childhood and the virus remains quiescent in the kidneys, bone marrow and lymphoid tissue. Upon reactivation, a productive infection of brain oligodendrocytes results in demyelination. The presenting symptoms include muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties.
