Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound are useful because they may reveal tuberculous lesions, metastases or a primary neoplasm.

Cerebral imaging plays an important role in diagnosing FBLs; however, availability is extremely limited in resource-constrained settings. CT may at times produce non-specific results confirming the clinical diagnosis of an FBL but failing to assist the clinician in narrowing down the spectrum of differential diagnoses. MRI is more informative; however, it is practically unavailable as a routine investigation in tropical low- and middle-income settings. Cystic lesions on CT are indicative of neurocysticercosis. Cerebral oedema with mass effect and contrast enhancement would favour cerebral abscess, tuberculoma, toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma, whereas PML classically shows no mass effect and no enhancement. Meningeal enhancement is typical for tuberculosis.
