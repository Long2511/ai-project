The differential diagnosis of focal brain lesions (FBLs) in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries is broad. Patients may suffer from HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma and CMV encephalitis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the brain parenchyma can present as tuberculoma or tuberculous abscess.

Furthermore, HIV-positive individuals may suffer from conditions primarily unrelated to their HIV infection such as a brain tumour, brain metastases or a cerebral abscess.

Endemic 'tropical' diseases such as neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis or, in Latin America, Chagas' disease, can also present with focal brain lesions and should be considered according to the local epidemiological pattern.
