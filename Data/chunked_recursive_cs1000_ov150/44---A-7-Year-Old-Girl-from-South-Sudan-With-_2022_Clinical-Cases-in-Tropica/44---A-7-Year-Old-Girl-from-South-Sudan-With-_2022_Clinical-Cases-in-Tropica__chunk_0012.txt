In low-resource settings, diagnostic options for VL are often limited. On FBC all three cell lines can be depleted. Demonstration of Leishmania amastigotes in samples from bone marrow, spleen and lymph node is the classic confirmatory test for VL. Under field conditions, direct proof of the parasite is often not feasible, and several serological tests have been developed instead. Sensitivity and specificity of these tests generally vary and they should always be used in combination with a standardized case definition as suggested by the WHO.

The rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT) and the direct agglutination test (DAT) were found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity. The rK39 ICTs are easy to perform, rapid (10-20 minutes), cheap and give easily reproducible results. The semiquantitative DAT has a longer turnaround time of about 24 hours, and requires a laboratory with well-trained technicians.
