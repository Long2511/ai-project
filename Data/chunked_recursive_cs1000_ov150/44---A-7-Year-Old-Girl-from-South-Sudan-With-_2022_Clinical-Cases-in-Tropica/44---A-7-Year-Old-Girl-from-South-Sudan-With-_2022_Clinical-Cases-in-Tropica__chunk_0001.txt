A 7-year-old girl is presented at a clinic in South Sudan with a 4-week history of undulating fever. The fever occurs mainly in the afternoon hours accompanied by chills and sometimes convulsions. Between the febrile episodes she was initially fine and played normally. However, over time she has devel­oped progressive anorexia, dry cough, chest pain, joint and back pain.

She has never been admitted to a hospital, but she has pre­sented at another clinic recently where she received some unspecified tablets that did not bring any improvement.
