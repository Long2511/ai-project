The fever occurs mainly in the afternoon hours accompanied by chills and sometimes convulsions. Between the febrile episodes she was initially fine and played normally. However, over time she has devel­oped progressive anorexia, dry cough, chest pain, joint and back pain.\n\nShe has never been admitted to a hospital, but she has pre­sented at another clinic recently where she received some unspecified tablets that did not bring any improvement."}

Her vital signs are: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96bpm, blood pressure 100/ 60 mmHg. Her chest sounds clear; normal heart sounds; soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes of about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal and epitro­chlear region. There are no skin lesions and no peripheral oedema.\n\nPlasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria parasites are negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) is negative. Visceral leishmaniasis: rK39-antibody RDT is negative.\n\nOn admission, the patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 1.35 ×10⁹/L against a reference range of 4-10. Her haemoglobin was 6.8 g/dL compared to a reference of 12-16, and her platelet count was 98 ×10⁹/L, below the reference range of 150-300."}

On examination she is pale and severely malnour­ished. She has splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenop­athy. The full blood count (FBC) shows pancytopenia. Serological rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, brucellosis and visceral leishmaniasis are negative.\n\nChronic fever, splenomegaly and wasting in a child from South Sudan should raise the suspicion of visceral leishman­iasis or brucellosis. Tuberculosis and HIV infection both need to be ruled out, because they can cause chronic fever, anorexia, weight loss, splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy."}

In addition, the chronic fever is unusual; in a child one might expect a more acute course. Furthermore, malaria does not cause any lymphadenopathy. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly syndrome (HMS) has been described in children. It can cause gross splenomegaly and anaemia in regions hyperen­demic for malaria, but HMS does not present with a fever, neither is lymphadenopathy part of the picture.\n\nTyphoid fever can present with persistent fever and splenomegaly; a dry cough is also common. The duration of fever in this case may be slightly too long though, and gen­eralized lymphadenopathy is not a common feature of typhoid.\n\nA splenic abscess could cause chronic fever and spleno­megaly, but would not explain the generalized lymphade­nopathy and the haematological changes, unless the patient was acutely septic."}

The history should be taken as accurately as possible to narrow down the differen­tial diagnosis. One should try to find out if the patient comes from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic. For possible HIV infection, it would be of great importance to find out if the parents and siblings are alive and well; and enquiries should be made if there are any close contacts who are suspected to have TB or who have a history of recent TB treatment."}

Gold standard for diagnosis of VL is the proof of the parasite in tissue specimens. However, this is often not feasible under field conditions and serological tests are used instead. The rapid antigen test for VL (rK39) used in this case was negative (sensitivity of this test in South Sudan is 85–90%).\n\nBecause VL is high on the list of differential diagnoses, a second serological test such as the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) should be done, and direct proof of the parasite should be attempted."}

Splenic aspiration is complicated with life­threatening haemorrhages in about 0.1% of procedures and therefore requires strict precautions, technical expertise and postinterventional monitoring.\n\nBlood cultures, if available, would be helpful for diagnosis of typhoid fever, brucellosis and septicaemia.\n\nThe mother of the patient reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis was known. It turned out that the uncle of the child had been treated for VL before. The girl's sister had recently been treated for TB.\n\nThe child's health continued to deteriorate. She had per­sistently high fever and became increasingly pale.\n\nThe DAT came back positive with a high titre (≥1:6.400), which supported the suspected diagnosis of vis­ceral leishmaniasis."}

The girl also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation.\n\nAfter 5 days, the fever settled and the patient started to recover. Two weeks later the girl had gained some weight and was again able to walk and play."}

Large epidemics have been described in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. As a result of efforts to eliminate the disease on the Indian subcontinent, the incidence of VL has decreased substantially in the past decade. Ninety per cent of all cases occur in only five countries: India, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil.\n\nTransmission can be anthroponotic or zoonotic, differing by region and parasite strain. Humans most commonly acquire VL through the bite of an infected female sandfly, but other modes of transmission have been described.\n\nLeishmania promastigotes invade cells of the human reticu­loendothelial system where they metamorphose into amastigotes and multiply. The incubation period varies greatly, from 10 days to several years, but usually takes between 2 and 8 months."}

Most infections remain asymptomatic.\n\nClinical VL presents with symptoms and signs of a chronic systemic infection (fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) and of parasite invasion of the mononuclear phagocyte system (enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) resulting in severe immunosuppression. In India, hyperpigmentation has led to the name 'kala-azar' (Hindi for 'black sickness'). VL is typically fatal if not treated, and potentially fatal complications include bacterial superinfections and congestive heart failure because of severe anaemia and haemorrhage."}
{"id": "44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica__0012", "text": "In low-resource settings, diagnostic options for VL are often limited. On FBC all three cell lines can be depleted. Demonstration of Leishmania amastigotes in samples from bone marrow, spleen and lymph node is the classic confirmatory test for VL. Under field conditions, direct proof of the parasite is often not feasible, and several serological tests have been developed instead. Sensitivity and specificity of these tests generally vary and they should always be used in combination with a standardized case definition as suggested by the WHO.\n\nThe rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT) and the direct agglutination test (DAT) were found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity. The rK39 ICTs are easy to perform, rapid (10-20 minutes), cheap and give easily reproducible results. The semiquantitative DAT has a longer turnaround time of about 24 hours, and requires a laboratory with well-trained technicians."}
{"id": "44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica__0013", "text": "Treatment of VL is complex: efficacy of the individual drugs varies geographically and depends on parasite susceptibility and the immune status of the patient. Parenteral drugs currently used are pentavalent antimonials, paromomycin and (liposomal) amphotericin B. The oral drug in use is miltefosine. Combinations of antileishmanial drugs seem to help shorten therapy courses, reduce side effects, improve treatment out­comes, delay resistance development and reduce treatment costs.\n\nIn HIV patients, VL is even more difficult to treat because it does not respond well to the classic antileishmanial drugs and has a higher tendency to relapse."}
