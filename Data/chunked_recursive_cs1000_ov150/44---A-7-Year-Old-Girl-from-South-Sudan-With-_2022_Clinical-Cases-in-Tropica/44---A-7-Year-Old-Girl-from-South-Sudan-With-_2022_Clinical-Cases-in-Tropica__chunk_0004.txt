Malaria can cause fever, anaemia and splenomegaly, but two different negative tests make this unlikely. In addition, the chronic fever is unusual; in a child one might expect a more acute course. Furthermore, malaria does not cause any lymphadenopathy. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly syndrome (HMS) has been described in children. It can cause gross splenomegaly and anaemia in regions hyperen­demic for malaria, but HMS does not present with a fever, neither is lymphadenopathy part of the picture.

Typhoid fever can present with persistent fever and splenomegaly; a dry cough is also common. The duration of fever in this case may be slightly too long though, and gen­eralized lymphadenopathy is not a common feature of typhoid.

A splenic abscess could cause chronic fever and spleno­megaly, but would not explain the generalized lymphade­nopathy and the haematological changes, unless the patient was acutely septic.
