The clinical presentation depends on the infecting species, as well as on the host's genetic background and immune status. Most infections remain asymptomatic.

Clinical VL presents with symptoms and signs of a chronic systemic infection (fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) and of parasite invasion of the mononuclear phagocyte system (enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) resulting in severe immunosuppression. In India, hyperpigmentation has led to the name 'kala-azar' (Hindi for 'black sickness'). VL is typically fatal if not treated, and potentially fatal complications include bacterial superinfections and congestive heart failure because of severe anaemia and haemorrhage.
