Sensitivity is highest for splenic aspirates (93–99%), fol­lowed by bone marrow (53–86%) and lymph node aspira­tion (53–65%), which can be further increased by culture and PCR. Splenic aspiration is complicated with life­threatening haemorrhages in about 0.1% of procedures and therefore requires strict precautions, technical expertise and postinterventional monitoring.

Blood cultures, if available, would be helpful for diagnosis of typhoid fever, brucellosis and septicaemia.

The mother of the patient reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis was known. It turned out that the uncle of the child had been treated for VL before. The girl's sister had recently been treated for TB.

The child's health continued to deteriorate. She had per­sistently high fever and became increasingly pale.

The DAT came back positive with a high titre (≥1:6.400), which supported the suspected diagnosis of vis­ceral leishmaniasis.
