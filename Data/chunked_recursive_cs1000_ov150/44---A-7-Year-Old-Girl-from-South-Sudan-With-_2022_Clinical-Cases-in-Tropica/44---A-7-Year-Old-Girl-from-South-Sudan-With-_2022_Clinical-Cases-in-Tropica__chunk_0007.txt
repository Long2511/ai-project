The clinician has to cope with the investigations available, which may commonly not be in line with the internationally recommended standards. Gold standard for diagnosis of VL is the proof of the parasite in tissue specimens. However, this is often not feasible under field conditions and serological tests are used instead. The rapid antigen test for VL (rK39) used in this case was negative (sensitivity of this test in South Sudan is 85–90%).

Because VL is high on the list of differential diagnoses, a second serological test such as the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) should be done, and direct proof of the parasite should be attempted.
