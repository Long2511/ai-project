VL is a vector-borne systemic parasitic infection caused by Leishmania protozoans, most commonly L. donovani and L. infantum. Large epidemics have been described in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. As a result of efforts to eliminate the disease on the Indian subcontinent, the incidence of VL has decreased substantially in the past decade. Ninety per cent of all cases occur in only five countries: India, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil.

Transmission can be anthroponotic or zoonotic, differing by region and parasite strain. Humans most commonly acquire VL through the bite of an infected female sandfly, but other modes of transmission have been described.

Leishmania promastigotes invade cells of the human reticu­loendothelial system where they metamorphose into amastigotes and multiply. The incubation period varies greatly, from 10 days to several years, but usually takes between 2 and 8 months.
