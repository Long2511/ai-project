In a resource-constrained place like South Sudan, a prag­matic clinical approach is necessary. The history should be taken as accurately as possible to narrow down the differen­tial diagnosis. One should try to find out if the patient comes from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic. For possible HIV infection, it would be of great importance to find out if the parents and siblings are alive and well; and enquiries should be made if there are any close contacts who are suspected to have TB or who have a history of recent TB treatment.
