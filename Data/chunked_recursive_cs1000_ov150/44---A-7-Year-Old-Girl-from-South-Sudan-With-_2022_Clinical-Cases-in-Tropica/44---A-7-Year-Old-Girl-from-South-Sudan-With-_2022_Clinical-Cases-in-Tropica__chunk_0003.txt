In South Sudan, a young girl presents with a 4-week history of fever, progressive anorexia, general body pains and a dry cough. On examination she is pale and severely malnour­ished. She has splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenop­athy. The full blood count (FBC) shows pancytopenia. Serological rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, brucellosis and visceral leishmaniasis are negative.

Chronic fever, splenomegaly and wasting in a child from South Sudan should raise the suspicion of visceral leishman­iasis or brucellosis. Tuberculosis and HIV infection both need to be ruled out, because they can cause chronic fever, anorexia, weight loss, splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy.
