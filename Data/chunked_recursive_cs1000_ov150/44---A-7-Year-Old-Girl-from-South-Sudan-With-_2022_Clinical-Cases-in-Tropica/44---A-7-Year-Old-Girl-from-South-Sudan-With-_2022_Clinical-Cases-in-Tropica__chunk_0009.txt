The DAT came back positive with a high titre (≥1:6.400), which supported the suspected diagnosis of vis­ceral leishmaniasis.

Considering her critical condition, with severe malnutri­tion and progressive anaemia, the patient was started on lipo­somal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). The girl also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation.

After 5 days, the fever settled and the patient started to recover. Two weeks later the girl had gained some weight and was again able to walk and play.
