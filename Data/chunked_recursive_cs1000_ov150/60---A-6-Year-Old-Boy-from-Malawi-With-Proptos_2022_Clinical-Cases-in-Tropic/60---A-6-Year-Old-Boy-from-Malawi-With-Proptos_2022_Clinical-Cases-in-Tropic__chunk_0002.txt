This is a rapidly developing proptosis in a boy who lives in a malaria-endemic area; the most likely diagnosis is Burkitt's lymphoma.

The second possibility is that it is another type of B cell lymphoma; and the third possibility is rhabdomyosarcoma.
It is not a retinoblastoma, which starts in the eye and usually, but not always, presents at an earlier age. The process is painless, which excludes infection, and it is non-pulsating which makes the diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation unlikely. Lachrymal gland tumours are more anteromedial than this mass.
