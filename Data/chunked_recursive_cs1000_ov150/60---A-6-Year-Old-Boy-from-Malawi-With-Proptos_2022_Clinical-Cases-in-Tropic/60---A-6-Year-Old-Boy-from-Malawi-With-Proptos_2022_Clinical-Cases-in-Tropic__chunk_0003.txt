There are three questions to ask: what is it, where is it and is it safe to treat?
What is it? A thorough history and physical examination will narrow the field. Is this a multifocal or localized lesion? Knowing the age will rule in some more likely diagnoses and rule out others. Are there any systemic or neurological signs and symptoms? A fine-needle aspirate (FNA) or biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.
Where is it? Again, the examination will assist. An abdominal ultrasound scan will demonstrate any intra-abdominal masses and organ involvement. A cytospun sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be examined for malignant cells; a full blood count (FBC) should also be done and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) examined. A chest radiograph is useful if intrathoracic pathology is suspected.
