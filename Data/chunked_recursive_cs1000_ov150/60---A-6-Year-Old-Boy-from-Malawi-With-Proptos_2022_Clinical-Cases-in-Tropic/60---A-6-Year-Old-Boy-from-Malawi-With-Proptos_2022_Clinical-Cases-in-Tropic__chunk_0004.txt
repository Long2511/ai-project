Is it safe to treat? Anaemia (<7g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (<50 × 10⁹/L) should be corrected before giving chemotherapy. A blood film and stool and urine samples should be examined to exclude or treat malaria or any other invasive parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis or strongyloidiasis. The abdominal ultrasound scan will demonstrate any renal involvement and forewarn of possible complications when treatment is given. Baseline renal function and liver function tests are useful but not essential. HIV status will not affect the treatment; but if positive, infections and anaemia should be anticipated during chemotherapy.
