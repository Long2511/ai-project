A 6-year-old Malawian boy from the lakeshore of Lake Malawi presents with a painless, proptosed left eye that his family first noticed 3 weeks ago. It has worsened rapidly though his vision is still normal. He denies any pain.

On examination he is afebrile, the right eye is normal, the left eye is proptosed but non-pulsating (Fig. 60.1). The pupil is round and clear and responds well to light. When he is asked to follow an object with his eyes the left eyeball hardly moves. He has no other swellings or abnormalities; and though he is thin, he is not malnourished.
