The boy was admitted and a full work-up was done as a matter of urgency (FNA, BMA, FBC, lumbar puncture (LP), HIV antibody test, stool and urine microscopy) and an abdominal scan was carried out. This was to enable treatment for presumed Burkitt's lymphoma to start as soon as possible to prevent further proptosis and irreversible damage to the eye. Delay could mean the eye losing its blood supply and 'melting', leaving the boy sightless in that eye.
When the LP was done, intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone were given as prophylaxis against CNS involvement. Oral allopurinol and hyperhydration were commenced; chemotherapy was given the next day. The eye looked less proptosed within 48 hours and was back to normal within a week. He had four courses of chemotherapy in the next 30 days (Fig. 60.2). A year later he was free of disease and pronounced cured.
