With manipulation of the aspirator and forceps, a white tape-like body at the centre of the targeted lesion is exposed, and complete removal of a live worm-like structure is carefully performed. A presumed diagnosis of sparganosis is made.\n\nA 64-year old Japanese man presents with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Imaging reveals an elongated structure in the right occipital lobe. During neurosurgery, a live worm-like structure is removed from the brain, identified as a sparganum."}

Adult worms inhabit the intestines of cats and dogs, and produce eggs that are discharged in faeces. In fresh water, coracidia hatch from the eggs to be ingested by cope-pods and develop into first stage (procercoid) larvae.\nWhen copepods are ingested by the second intermediate host (e.g. frogs, fish, snakes, birds), the procercoid larvae mature into plerocercoid sparganum larvae and migrate to the muscle and subcutaneous tissue. The cycle is completed when a carnivorous mammal eats the second intermediate host.\nHumans can become infected by ingesting the first or sec-ond intermediate host, i.e. by drinking water containing infected copepods, eating undercooked meat from infected snakes, frogs, or birds, or by the use of poultices produced from infested frog or snake flesh or skin on open wounds or eyes."}

The infection route in the present case was prob-ably through consumption of raw chicken meat, which the patient ate approximately once a month before the general-ized seizure."}

Cases have been mainly reported from Asian countries, especially China, South Korea, Thailand and Japan, and the most commonly observed clinical manifestation is epileptic seizures. Diagno-sis is based upon dependable history taking and serological investigations. Neuroimaging, especially MRI, is helpful for the diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis. The most character-istic finding is the “tunnel sign” in post-contrast MRI, which appears as hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images.\n\nThe treatment of choice is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. However, in a small-sample non-randomized retrospective study, high-dose praziquantel had an efficacy similar to that of surgical removal with respect to the primary outcome (complete disappearance of active lesions in cere-bral MRI findings)."}

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results of serum and cerebrospinal fluid revealed strong positivity for Spirometra mansoni.\n\nCerebral sparganosis is the infestation of the human brain by larvae of a zoonotic cestode of carnivorous mammals. It is a food-borne zoonosis acquired by drinking untreated freshwater or eating undercooked meat of snakes and frogs or by appli-cation of infested flesh on open wounds or the eyes during medical procedures. The incubation period is 6 to 11 days but may be longer. The larvae can survive in the human host for up to 20 years."}

Spinal sparganosis may lead to paraplegia, as well as urinary and bowel incontinence.\nDiagnosis of cerebral sparganosis is made on the basis of a combination of clinical history, laboratory tests (eosinophilia, positive serology), CT and MRI, and histopathology findings including the identification of the larva itself, if available. Recent advances in imaging technology, especially MRI, are key for diagnosis.\nDifferential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis and paragonimiasis.\nAn HIV test should be done in any person with unclear CNS lesions. In immunocompromised patients, cerebral toxoplas-mosis has to be considered, as well as cerebral cryptococco-mas and tuberculomas."}
