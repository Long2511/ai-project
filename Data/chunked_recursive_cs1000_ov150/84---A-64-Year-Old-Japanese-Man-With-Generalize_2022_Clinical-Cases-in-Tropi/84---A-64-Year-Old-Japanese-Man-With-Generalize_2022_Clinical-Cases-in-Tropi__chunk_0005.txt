Cerebral sparganosis is a rare disease, but should be con-sidered in patients from endemic areas presenting with symp-toms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion. Cases have been mainly reported from Asian countries, especially China, South Korea, Thailand and Japan, and the most commonly observed clinical manifestation is epileptic seizures. Diagno-sis is based upon dependable history taking and serological investigations. Neuroimaging, especially MRI, is helpful for the diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis. The most character-istic finding is the “tunnel sign” in post-contrast MRI, which appears as hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images.

The treatment of choice is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. However, in a small-sample non-randomized retrospective study, high-dose praziquantel had an efficacy similar to that of surgical removal with respect to the primary outcome (complete disappearance of active lesions in cere-bral MRI findings).
