A 64-year-old Japanese man is admitted to a local hospital in Japan because of generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by weakness of the right lower extremity.
He has a medical history of hypertension and right cere-bellar infarction; however, recent simple partial seizures were well controlled by administration of an antiepileptic agent.

On admission, the patient is afebrile, GCS is 15/15 and the neurological examination does not reveal any abnormality.

Laboratory results show no abnormalities, including no eosinophilia or leukocytosis.

Head CT reveals a small high-density nodule with an enhanced perifocal low-density area in the left occipital lobe.
MRI shows a ring-enhancing, tunnel-shaped lesion in the left occipital lobe.
Angiography findings are normal, except for right verte-bral artery occlusion, reflecting the history of right cerebellar infarction.
