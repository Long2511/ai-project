Cerebral sparganosis is the infestation of the human brain by larvae of a zoonotic cestode of carnivorous mammals. It is a food-borne zoonosis acquired by drinking untreated freshwater or eating undercooked meat of snakes and frogs or by appli-cation of infested flesh on open wounds or the eyes during medical procedures. The incubation period is 6 to 11 days but may be longer. The larvae can survive in the human host for up to 20 years.
