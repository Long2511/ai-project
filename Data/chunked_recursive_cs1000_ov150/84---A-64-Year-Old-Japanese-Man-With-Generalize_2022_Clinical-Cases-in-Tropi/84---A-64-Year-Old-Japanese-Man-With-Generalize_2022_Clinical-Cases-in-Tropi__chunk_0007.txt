Most cases occur in Asia, but sporadic cases have been reported from many other parts of the world.
Cerebral infestation may manifest like any space-occupying lesion with headache, confusion, seizures, paraesthesias or palsies. Spinal sparganosis may lead to paraplegia, as well as urinary and bowel incontinence.
Diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis is made on the basis of a combination of clinical history, laboratory tests (eosinophilia, positive serology), CT and MRI, and histopathology findings including the identification of the larva itself, if available. Recent advances in imaging technology, especially MRI, are key for diagnosis.
Differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis and paragonimiasis.
An HIV test should be done in any person with unclear CNS lesions. In immunocompromised patients, cerebral toxoplas-mosis has to be considered, as well as cerebral cryptococco-mas and tuberculomas.
