Spargana are the larvae of zoonotic tapeworms of the genus Spirometra. Adult worms inhabit the intestines of cats and dogs, and produce eggs that are discharged in faeces. In fresh water, coracidia hatch from the eggs to be ingested by cope-pods and develop into first stage (procercoid) larvae.
When copepods are ingested by the second intermediate host (e.g. frogs, fish, snakes, birds), the procercoid larvae mature into plerocercoid sparganum larvae and migrate to the muscle and subcutaneous tissue. The cycle is completed when a carnivorous mammal eats the second intermediate host.
Humans can become infected by ingesting the first or sec-ond intermediate host, i.e. by drinking water containing infected copepods, eating undercooked meat from infected snakes, frogs, or birds, or by the use of poultices produced from infested frog or snake flesh or skin on open wounds or eyes.
