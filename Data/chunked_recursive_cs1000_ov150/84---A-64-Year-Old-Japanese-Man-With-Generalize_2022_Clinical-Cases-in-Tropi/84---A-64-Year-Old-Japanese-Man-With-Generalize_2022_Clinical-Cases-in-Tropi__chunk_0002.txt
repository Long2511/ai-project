Open surgery with craniotomy targeting the lesion is per-formed. With manipulation of the aspirator and forceps, a white tape-like body at the centre of the targeted lesion is exposed, and complete removal of a live worm-like structure is carefully performed. A presumed diagnosis of sparganosis is made.

A 64-year old Japanese man presents with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Imaging reveals an elongated structure in the right occipital lobe. During neurosurgery, a live worm-like structure is removed from the brain, identified as a sparganum.
