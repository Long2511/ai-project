His presentation should raise suspicion of a cystobiliary fistula with biliary obstruction, which is the most common acute complication in cystic echinococcosis and may be complicated by bacterial cholangitis.
In case of biliary obstruction, the first step is to restore the biliary flow by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). ERC is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in cases of biliary obstruction; cyst content can be extracted from the hepatic or common bile duct. In case of bacterial cholangitis, the patient should receive antibiotic treatment to cover for Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes.
Once biliary flow is restored and cholangitis has settled, the cyst can be surgically removed in a second step.
The main differential diagnoses in this patient with cystic liver lesions and liquid cyst content are a congenital simple hepatic cyst and pseudocysts (necrotic cavity) in alveolar echinococcosis (E. multilocularis).
