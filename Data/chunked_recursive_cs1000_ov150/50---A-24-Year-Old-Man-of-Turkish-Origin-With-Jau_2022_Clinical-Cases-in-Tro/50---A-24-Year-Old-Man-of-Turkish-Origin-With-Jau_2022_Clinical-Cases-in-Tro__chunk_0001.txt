A 24-year-old man of Turkish origin presents at a hospital in Germany because of right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting.
The patient is a German resident but visits his family in rural eastern Turkey (Anatolia) every year for about 6 weeks.
Three years earlier the patient had presented with right upper quadrant pain. Then, an ultrasound and a CT scan of the liver had revealed two calcified cystic lesions, one in the right liver lobe, another smaller cyst in the left liver lobe. Serology was positive for Echinococcus granulosus and a diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) was made.
Since both cyst walls were already calcified, anthelmintic treatment was not considered an option as the bioavailability of albendazole in cysts with calcified cyst walls is rather poor. Being free of symptoms, the patient refused surgical treatment. The cysts were monitored regularly by ultrasound for signs of spontaneous involution.
