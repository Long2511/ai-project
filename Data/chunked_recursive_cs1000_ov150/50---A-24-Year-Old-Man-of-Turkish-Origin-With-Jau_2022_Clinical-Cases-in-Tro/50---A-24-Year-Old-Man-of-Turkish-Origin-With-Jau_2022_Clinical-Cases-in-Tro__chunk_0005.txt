CE is generally a benign disease with the exception of complicated cysts; in this case a cyst with biliary fistula. CE cysts are currently classified by the WHO into six stages: CE1 and 2 (active), CE3a and 3b (transitional) and CE4 and 5 (inactive).
A very important question is which cysts can be left untreated and only observed ('watch and wait'). There is fairly solid evidence that inactive CE4 and CE5 cysts can be left untreated if they are not in critical sites.
In this patient the cyst walls of both cysts (CE1, CE3b) were calcified. Previously, calcification was described only as a feature of CE5 cysts; this was later extended to CE4 cysts and has now been shown to occur in all cyst stages.
Retrospectively this case illustrates that surgical treatment was rightly offered to the patient at initial diagnosis.
