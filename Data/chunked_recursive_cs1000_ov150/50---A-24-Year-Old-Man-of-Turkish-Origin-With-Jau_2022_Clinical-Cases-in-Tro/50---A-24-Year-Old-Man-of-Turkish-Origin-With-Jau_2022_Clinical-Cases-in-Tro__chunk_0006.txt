Retrospectively this case illustrates that surgical treatment was rightly offered to the patient at initial diagnosis.
Cystobiliary fistulas are some of the major reasons for complications in CE of the liver (as are cystobronchial fistulas in pulmonary CE). Fistulating cysts should be surgically treated before complications arise. The key question is how to identify fistulas early to prevent complications. Previously, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) has been advocated as the method of choice. However, it has become evident that intracystic pressure may be too high for the contrast medium to enter. If available, MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is an alternative option, with very good detection rates.
CE is an infection with the larval form of the dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It occurs worldwide with high endemicity in the Mediterranean basin, the Near and Middle East, North and East Africa, central Asia and Latin America.
