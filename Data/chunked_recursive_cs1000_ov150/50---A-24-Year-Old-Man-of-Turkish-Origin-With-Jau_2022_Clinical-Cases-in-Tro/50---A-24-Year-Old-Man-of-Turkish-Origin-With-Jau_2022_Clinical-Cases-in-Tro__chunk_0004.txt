Depending on the presence of systemic symptoms and signs and liquid versus solid cyst content, infectious causes like abscesses (bacterial, amoebic) or tuberculoma must be considered.
In addition, benign and malignant liver tumours or metastases are relevant differentials.
On ERC, biliary obstruction because of a cystobiliary fistula was found. CE cyst content was removed from the common bile duct and the bile flow was restored. The patient's cholangitis was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Once the inflammation settled, the patient was referred for surgery and partial cystectomy was performed on both cysts.
The patient has been followed up for 9 years after surgery and has had no recurrence. He is considered cured and further follow-up visits are not needed.
This case illustrates several learning points. In countries with low CE-endemicity provenance from a hyperendemic region is the single most important risk factor for CE in cystic liver lesions.
