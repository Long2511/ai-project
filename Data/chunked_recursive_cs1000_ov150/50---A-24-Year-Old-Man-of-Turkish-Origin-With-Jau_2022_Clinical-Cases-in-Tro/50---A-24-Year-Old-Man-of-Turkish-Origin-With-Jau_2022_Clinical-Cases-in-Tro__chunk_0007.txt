Humans become infected by ingestion of eggs of E. granulosus.
Symptoms may occur months to years after infection because of mass effects of the growing cyst or because of complications. Liver (70%) and lung (15–30%) are the most commonly affected organs. Cyst complications include fistulas leading to biliary or bronchial obstruction, bacterial superinfection, cyst rupture leading to anaphylaxis, embolism of cyst content and compression syndromes.
Diagnosis of CE is based on imaging, mainly on ultrasound, which is crucial for the diagnosis and classification of disease activity. MRI or CT should be used when cysts are inaccessible by ultrasound.
Serology is hampered by a lack of sensitivity and specificity. In unclear cases, diagnostic cyst puncture and aspiration may be performed by experienced examiners. If CE is suspected, however, albendazole needs to be given peri-interventionally.
