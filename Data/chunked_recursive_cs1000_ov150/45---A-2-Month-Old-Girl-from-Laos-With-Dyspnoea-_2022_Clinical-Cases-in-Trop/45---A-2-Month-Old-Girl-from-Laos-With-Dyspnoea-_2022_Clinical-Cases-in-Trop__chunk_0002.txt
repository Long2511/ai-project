A young Lao mother presents with her 2-month-old baby girl, who has been acutely unwell for the past 3 days. The child has been breastfeeding poorly and was noted to have been grunting, which is a non-specific sign of severe systemic illness in infants. On examination, the child is irritable, cyanosed and shows signs of heart failure.

The most important differential diagnoses to consider are congenital heart disease, respiratory diseases (e.g. bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis and laryngitis), meningitis and infantile beriberi (thiamine or vitamin B₁ deficiency).
