Prolonged food avoidance post-partum is common in lowland Lao culture. It is based upon the traditional belief that certain food items may harm the newborn. Most lowland mothers eat milled glutinous rice but avoid eating fruits and vegetables, which results in low diet diversity for some months before and after delivery.

Thiamine deficiency may be one result of such dietary restriction, and affected mothers secrete insufficient levels of thiamine in their breastmilk. The cardiac form of thiamine deficiency usually manifests during the second or third month of life. Infants present with dyspnoea, cyanosis, vomiting and irritability.

Children with infantile beriberi respond rapidly (i.e. within 30-60 min) to intravenous or intramuscular thiamine (50 mg), which should urgently be administered. The child should be closely monitored.
