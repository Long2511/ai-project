Infantile beriberi is usually diagnosed clinically because of the need to act before biochemical results are available and the lack of laboratories in endemic areas that can perform thiamine biochemical assays. Treatment of infantile beriberi with thiamine is simple, inexpensive and highly effective. It should be administered parenterally to rapidly increase tissue thiamine levels. Thiamine supplementation should also be given to the mothers of infants with beriberi. Education about thiamine-rich foods (e.g. pulses, groundnuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables) and on the danger of food avoidance should be provided before discharge. Prevention is crucial: better understanding of post-partum diets, and on how to change the practice of food avoidance is very important and thiamine supplementation for mothers is urgently needed.
