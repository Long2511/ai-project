The mother reported that her child had been exclusively breastfed and that she had practiced food avoidance since delivery: She had avoided eating beef, pork, vegetables and fruits. The mother said that she herself had anorexia, weakness, a husky voice, and paresthesias affecting her limbs — symptoms of thiamine deficiency.

Intravenous thiamine (50 mg) was given immediately to the child after admission and she quickly and dramatically responded. Six hours later the baby was able to breastfeed normally and was discharged the following day. Blood samples were taken from the child and the mother. Analysis showed that both were thiamine-deficient.

The mother was given oral thiamine supplementation and advised to return to a well-balanced diet including thiamine-rich foods.
