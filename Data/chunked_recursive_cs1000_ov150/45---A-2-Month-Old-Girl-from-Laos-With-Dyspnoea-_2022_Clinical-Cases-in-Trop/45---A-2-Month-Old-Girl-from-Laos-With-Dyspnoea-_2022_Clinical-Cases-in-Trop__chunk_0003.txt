However, the absence of cough, wheeze and fever, along with a normal chest examination, suggest that respiratory diseases are unlikely. The fact that the cyanosis has started well after birth along with the sudden onset of symptoms and the absence of a heart murmur suggests that congenital heart disease is unlikely. Absence of fever or bulging fontanels makes meningitis unlikely. The combination of dyspnoea, poor breastfeeding, abnormal cry, grunting and swollen extremities in a suitable endemic setting (South-east Asia) suggest infantile beriberi as the most likely diagnosis.

The most important information to be obtained from the mother is whether the child has been exclusively breastfed, whether the mother had practiced food avoidance during pregnancy and/or post-partum, and whether the mother herself has had any symptoms and signs suggestive of beriberi, such as paresthesias and difficulty rising from a squatting position.
