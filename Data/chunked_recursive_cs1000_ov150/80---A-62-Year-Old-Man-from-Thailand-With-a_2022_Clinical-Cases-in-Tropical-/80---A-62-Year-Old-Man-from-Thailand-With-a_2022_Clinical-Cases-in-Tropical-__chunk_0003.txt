1. What is your differential diagnosis?
2. What additional information should you obtain from the patient?

A 62-year-old asymptomatic Thai man undergoes his annual physical check-up. Ultrasound incidentally detects a solitary liver mass. Liver function tests are normal, and Hepatitis B serology suggests previous infection. The CA19-9 level is markedly elevated.

The most important differential diagnoses in this Thai man in his sixties are hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a metastatic tumour and some infections, including tuberculosis.

In an otherwise asymptomatic patient with a high serum CA19-9 level without a history and signs of chronic viral hepatitis, CCA is the most likely diagnosis. Metastatic cancer should be considered and thorough investigation is required to detect the primary site of the tumour.
