Kalasin, where the patient comes from, is a province in northeast Thailand. Given his region of origin it is important to ask for a history of eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish, which frequently contains metacercariae of the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini.

Traditional food containing undercooked freshwater fish is usually eaten among the villagers in the region including their children. Exposure to the fluke early in life is an impor­tant risk factor for the development of CCA. Liver fluke infection is easily treated with praziquantel; however, re-infection is common in an area where traditional food is regularly consumed.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent hemihepatectomy. A large tumour (9 × 9 cm) of whitish­yellowish colour was found in the right liver lobe. In addi­tion, liver flukes were detected in the adjacent bile duct. The liver parenchyma itself appeared non-cirrhotic.
