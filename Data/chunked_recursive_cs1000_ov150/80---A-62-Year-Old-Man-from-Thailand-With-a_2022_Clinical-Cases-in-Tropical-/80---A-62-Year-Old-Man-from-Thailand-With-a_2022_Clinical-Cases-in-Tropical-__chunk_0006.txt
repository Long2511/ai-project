The infection is acquired by eating raw freshwater fish and uncooked fermented fish containing metacercariae of the parasites. Adult worms live in the small intrahepatic bile ducts of their definitive host, which includes humans, cats, dogs and other mammals. They can live in the bile duct for over 20 years and re­infection may occur. Prevalence and intensity of infection increase with age.

Chronic infection may lead to periductal fibrosis, cholecystitis and gallstones. Mutagenesis is thought to be triggered by chronic mechanical and chemical irritation as well as immunological fac­tors. Besides the infection itself, cultural and lifestyle factors have recently been found to be relevant risk factors for CCA; among others, a combination of alcohol use and smoking.
