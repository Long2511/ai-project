The complex interaction of risk factors besides fluke infection may explain why despite the widespread availability of prazi­quantel and massive control efforts, CCA remains a major health problem in endemic regions in Asia.

CCA may long be asymptomatic, as shown in this case. Screening and early detection of CCA is crucial but challenging.

In Thailand, a comprehensive approach to prevention and control of liver fluke infection has been implemented under the “Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program” (CASCAP). Also, EcoHealth-based integrated control programmes such as the “Lawa model” have been successfully propagated at the community level. The “Lawa model” (referring to the fluke endemic Lawa lake region in Thailand) is a programme which includes treatment with anthelmintic drugs, intensive health education methods, ecosystem monitoring and active commu­nity participation.
