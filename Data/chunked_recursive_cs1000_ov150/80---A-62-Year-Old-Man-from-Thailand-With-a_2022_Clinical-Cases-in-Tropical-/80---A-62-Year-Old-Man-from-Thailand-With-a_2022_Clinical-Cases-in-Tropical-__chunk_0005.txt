Histology confirmed intrahepatic CCA and the patient was started on postoperative chemotherapy. Additional past medical history taken after surgery revealed that he had a history of liver fluke infection and praziquantel treatment in the past 10 years at the local primary care unit.

CCA is strongly associated with chronic liver fluke infection. O. viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis are therefore classified by WHO as biological carcinogens.

The Greater Mekong subregion has the highest reported incidence of liver fluke-associated CCA in the world. It is also endemic in East Asia (southern China, Korea, northern Vietnam) because of C. sinensis infection, and in Kazakhstan, Siberia, other parts of Russia and various European countries, where O. felineus is the major parasite.
