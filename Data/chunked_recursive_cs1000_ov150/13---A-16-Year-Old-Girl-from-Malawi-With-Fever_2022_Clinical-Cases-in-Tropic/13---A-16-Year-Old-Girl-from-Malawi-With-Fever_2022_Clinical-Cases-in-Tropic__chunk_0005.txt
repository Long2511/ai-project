An abdominal ultrasound should be done to rule out posthepatic causes of jaundice and to assess texture and size of liver and spleen.

On admission the patient was started on artemether/lumefantrine PO and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2g IV od). A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi. The antibiotic therapy was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg bid. On day 5 of antibiotic treatment the patient's fever started to settle and she was feeling better. She was discharged on day 7. Ciprofloxacin was continued for a total of 10 days. The patient was also given one dose of praziquantel, because co-infection with schistosomiasis seems to favour chronic carriage of S. Typhi and relapse, and Malawi is a country highly endemic for schistosomiasis.

Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi is an exclusively human disease and there is no animal reservoir. Typhoid is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid, caused by S. Paratyphi A, B and C.
