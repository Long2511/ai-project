Enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid) is another diagnosis to consider, particularly given her abdominal tenderness, her splenomegaly, her frontal headache and her relative bradycardia. Mild jaundice in enteric fever may be caused by hepatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis or haemolysis.

In HIV-positive patients an infection with invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) should be considered.

Blood cultures should be taken in any febrile patient regardless of the malaria test result to rule out bacterial sepsis and enteric fever. Her HIV test should be repeated.

Since she is symptomatic and has malaria parasites in her blood, she should receive antimalarials according to the national guidelines and the local resistance profile. She should also be given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for Gram-negative and, less likely, Gram-positive bacteria. A urinary dipstick could quickly help rule out a urinary tract infection.
