The enteric fevers, typhoid and paratyphoid, are endemic all over the tropical world. Incidence appears to be highest on the Indian subcontinent (approx. 500:100 000 per year in urban slums).

In endemic countries, enteric fevers are most common in children and adolescents, whereas adults have acquired immunity through previous exposures. Typhoid is usually acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated by faeces of a patient or carrier. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are major risk factors.

The incubation period of typhoid fever averages 10 to 20 days (range 3-56). It is shorter in paratyphoid (1-10 days).
