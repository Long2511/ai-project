A 16-year-old Malawian girl presents to the emergency room of a local hospital because of fever, generalized abdominal pain and frontal headache for the past 5 days.

She delivered a baby 5 months ago. An HIV test done in the antenatal clinic was negative. Her further past medical history is unremarkable.

She lives with her parents, her three siblings and her baby in an urban high-density area. There is no running water and no electricity in the house. The family fetch water from a community tap. The girl went to primary school but recently dropped out during her pregnancy.
