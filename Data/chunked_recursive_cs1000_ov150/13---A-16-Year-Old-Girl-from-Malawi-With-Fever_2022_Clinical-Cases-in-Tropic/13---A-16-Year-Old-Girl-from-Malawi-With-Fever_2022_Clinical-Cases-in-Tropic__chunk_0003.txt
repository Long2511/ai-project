The blood film for malaria parasites is positive, parasitaemia is described as "low". Liver function tests are not available because reagents are out of stock.

A 16-year-old girl presents with fever, abdominal pain and frontal headache. She has recently delivered a baby, otherwise her past medical history is unremarkable.

She is febrile, mildly jaundiced and there is diffuse abdominal tenderness with slight splenomegaly. There is mild normocytic anaemia. Malaria parasites are positive with low parasitaemia.

Malaria could explain most of her signs and symptoms, even though her abdominal pain would be unusual. However, in a malaria-endemic area where large parts of the population are semi-immune, low parasitaemia is common and often subclinical. Nevertheless, malaria itself, particularly if combined with severe anaemia, is a predisposing factor for Gramnegative bacteraemia and sepsis.
