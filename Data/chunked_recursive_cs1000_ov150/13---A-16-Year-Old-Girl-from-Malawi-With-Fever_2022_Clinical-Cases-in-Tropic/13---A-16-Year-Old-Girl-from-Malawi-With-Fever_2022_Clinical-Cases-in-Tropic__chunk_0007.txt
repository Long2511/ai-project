The incubation period of typhoid fever averages 10 to 20 days (range 3-56). It is shorter in paratyphoid (1-10 days).

Symptoms are nonspecific with fever, headache, dry cough and abdominal pain. Other than in malaria, fever starts insidiously and may go unnoticed by the patient for some time. Temperature typically rises in the evening hours and patients may be afebrile in the morning. Constipation is common, but foul-smelling diarrhoea may occur during the course of an untreated infection. Patients may become confused and apathetic and, if untreated, may die of myocarditis, overwhelming toxaemia, intestinal perforation or haemorrhage.

Full blood count typically shows leukopenia. Low-grade anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as slightly elevated transaminases are also common, but non-specific.
