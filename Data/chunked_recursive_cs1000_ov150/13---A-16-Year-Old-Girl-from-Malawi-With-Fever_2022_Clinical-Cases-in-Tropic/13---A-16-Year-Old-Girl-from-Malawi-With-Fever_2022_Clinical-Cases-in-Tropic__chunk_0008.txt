The definitive diagnosis of typhoid requires proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow. Isolation from stool or urine indicates carrier state but does not prove disease. The serological Widal test lacks both sensitivity and specificity and should be abandoned altogether. Novel and more promising serological tests are under development. Meanwhile, blood culture remains the diagnostic gold standard. In many low-resource settings, blood culture testing is however unavailable.

Patients with suspected enteric fever should be started on empirical antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic resistance patterns vary considerably between endemic areas. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance because they reach very high intracellular concentrations. Third-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin should be used in South Asia where fluoroquinolone resistance is common.
