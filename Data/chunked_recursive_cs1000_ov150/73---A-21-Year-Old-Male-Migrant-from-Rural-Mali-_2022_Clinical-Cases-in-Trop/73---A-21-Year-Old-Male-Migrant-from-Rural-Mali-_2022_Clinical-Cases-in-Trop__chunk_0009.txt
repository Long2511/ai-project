Shortly after treatment, authorities threatened to deport the patient back to Mali. A medical letter indicating that he was at high risk for splenic rupture, which at his home in rural Mali would mean certain death, was recognized and he was permitted to stay.

The patient has been monitored for a total of 2.5 years at the time of writing. IgM levels took 2 years to get back to normal. The size of the spleen slowly decreased; but at his last visit, remained slightly enlarged (14 cm in diameter).

At his last visit, the young man was well and spoke fluent German. He went to school in Germany and has learned to read and write. He planned to start vocational training to become a house painter.
