Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) can present with massive hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. Patients usually have a history of fever and weight loss and appear severely ill, which our patient did not.

Schistosomiasis is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Chronic S. mansoni infection causes liver fibrosis and secondary portal hypertension with splenomegaly and hypersplenism.

Liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis (so called “pipestem fibrosis") is usually easy to detect on ultrasound. In our patient, the liver appeared normal, and the flow of portal and splenic veins was normal as well, making portal hypertension of any cause unlikely.

Bacterial endocarditis and brucellosis may cause fever and splenomegaly; however, the spleen tends to be only moderately increased in size and there were no murmurs on ardiac examination.
