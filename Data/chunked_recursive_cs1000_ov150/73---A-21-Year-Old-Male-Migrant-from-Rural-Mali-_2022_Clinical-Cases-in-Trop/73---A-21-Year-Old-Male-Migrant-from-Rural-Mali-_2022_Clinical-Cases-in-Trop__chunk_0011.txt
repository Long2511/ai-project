HMS is more common in women than in men and mainly affects the age group between 20 and 40 years. There seems to be a genetic background, with ethnic and familial clustering. HMS has also been described in expatriates residing in malaria-endemic regions, and more and more cases are being described in refugees and migrants from malaria-endemic areas.

Diagnostic criteria were proposed by Fakunle in 1982 and include splenomegaly extending >10cm below the left costal margin without any other cause, elevated IgM, elevated antimalarial antibodies and favourable response to antimalarial prophylaxis.
