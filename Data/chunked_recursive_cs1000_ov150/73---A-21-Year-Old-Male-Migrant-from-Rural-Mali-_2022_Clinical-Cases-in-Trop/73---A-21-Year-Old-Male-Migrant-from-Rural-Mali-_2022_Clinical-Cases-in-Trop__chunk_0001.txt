A 21-year-old male migrant from rural Mali is referred to the tropical medicine department of a university hospital in Germany. He has just been worked-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at the haematology department. However, the underlying condition could not be established.

Clinically, the patient is quite well, he only reports intermittent fever, and some “heaviness" on the left side of his abdomen for some time (the duration is difficult to specify). There are no night sweats and his weight appears to be stable.

The patient migrated from rural Mali to Germany and arrived 1 year prior. During his journey he crossed Niger and spent a few weeks at a detention centre in Libya until he made his way across the Mediterranean and through Italy to Germany. He comes from a poor family and is unable to read and write.
