HMS, formerly known as tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), is one of the most common causes of massive splenomegaly in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission. Other important causes include lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis, haemoglobinopathies, schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis.

HMS is caused by an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae or P. vivax that results in an overproduction of polyclonal IgM. IgM forms aggregates and immune complexes, which are phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism.
