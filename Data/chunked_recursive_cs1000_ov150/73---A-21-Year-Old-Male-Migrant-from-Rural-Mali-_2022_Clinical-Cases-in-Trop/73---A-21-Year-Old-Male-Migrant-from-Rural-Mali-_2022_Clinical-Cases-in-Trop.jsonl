He has just been worked-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at the haematology department. However, the underlying condition could not be established.\n\nClinically, the patient is quite well, he only reports intermittent fever, and some “heaviness\" on the left side of his abdomen for some time (the duration is difficult to specify). There are no night sweats and his weight appears to be stable.\n\nThe patient migrated from rural Mali to Germany and arrived 1 year prior. During his journey he crossed Niger and spent a few weeks at a detention centre in Libya until he made his way across the Mediterranean and through Italy to Germany. He comes from a poor family and is unable to read and write."}

The symptoms have been present for some time.\n\nAt presentation he appears well and is afebrile. Gross splenomegaly is the only abnormal finding confirmed by ultrasound, which otherwise yields no pathological results. Laboratory results show mild bicytopenia, normal LDH and almost 4-fold increased immunoglobulin M (IgM). The systemic inflammatory markers are not elevated. Blood films for malaria parasites are negative, but malaria serology is positive.\n\nLymphoma or leukaemia is an important differential diagnosis to have in a patient with splenomegaly and fever anywhere in the world. However, in our patient it seems unlikely, because the differential count is normal, LDH, CRP and ESR are not elevated and the specialist work-up elsewhere did not yield a cause for his complaints."}

Patients usually have a history of fever and weight loss and appear severely ill, which our patient did not.\n\nSchistosomiasis is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Chronic S. mansoni infection causes liver fibrosis and secondary portal hypertension with splenomegaly and hypersplenism.\n\nLiver fibrosis in schistosomiasis (so called “pipestem fibrosis\") is usually easy to detect on ultrasound. In our patient, the liver appeared normal, and the flow of portal and splenic veins was normal as well, making portal hypertension of any cause unlikely.\n\nBacterial endocarditis and brucellosis may cause fever and splenomegaly; however, the spleen tends to be only moderately increased in size and there were no murmurs on ardiac examination."}

The most likely differential diagnosis for this patient therefore is hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS). HMS is the most common cause of massive splenomegaly in tropical areas with stable malaria transmission.\n\nAn HIV test should be ordered in any patient from Africa with a history of fever and/or thrombocytopenia.

Serologies for schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis were also negative, and the blood culture did not yield any pathogens. There were no ova of S. mansoni found in the stool.\n\nDespite the negative blood film, PCR for P. falciparum came back positive, making a diagnosis of hyperreactive splenomegaly very likely.\n\nThe patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and the reported episodes of fever subsided.

IgM levels took 2 years to get back to normal. The size of the spleen slowly decreased; but at his last visit, remained slightly enlarged (14 cm in diameter).\n\nAt his last visit, the young man was well and spoke fluent German.

Other important causes include lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis, haemoglobinopathies, schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis.\n\nHMS is caused by an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae or P. vivax that results in an overproduction of polyclonal IgM. IgM forms aggregates and immune complexes, which are phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism."}

There seems to be a genetic background, with ethnic and familial clustering. HMS has also been described in expatriates residing in malaria-endemic regions, and more and more cases are being described in refugees and migrants from malaria-endemic areas.\n\nDiagnostic criteria were proposed by Fakunle in 1982 and include splenomegaly extending >10cm below the left costal margin without any other cause, elevated IgM, elevated antimalarial antibodies and favourable response to antimalarial prophylaxis."}

Under those circumstances, clinicians are often limited to presumptive treatment with antimalarials of a patient with massive splenomegaly, and HMS may be difficult to differentiate from lymphoma.\n\nPatients most commonly present with symptoms of anaemia and abdominal heaviness or discomfort, some report episodes of low-grade fever. Full blood count usually shows anaemia, bi- or pancytopenia reflecting hypersplenism. Malaria microscopy is usually negative, because parasitaemia is kept at bay and therefore very low. However, molecular methods such as PCR may be able to detect low-level parasitaemia, as highlighted in this case."}

In migrants living in malaria non-endemic countries, one treatment course of antimalarials is enough to eliminate parasites as shown in this case, and repeated courses are not required. However, even after clearanc of infection splenic size and increased IgM may still take a long time to get back to normal ranges."}
