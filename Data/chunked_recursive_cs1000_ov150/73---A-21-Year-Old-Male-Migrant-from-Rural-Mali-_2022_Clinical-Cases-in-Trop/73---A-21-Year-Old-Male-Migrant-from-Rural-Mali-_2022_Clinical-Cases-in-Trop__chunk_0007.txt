EBV and CMV infections may cause ongoing fever and splenomegaly. Typical laboratory features include relative and absolute lymphocytosis, elevated LDH and liver transaminases, which our patient does not have. In Africa, most people will be exposed to both viruses already in childhood.

Our patient shows remarkably high IgM titres, positive malaria serology and a negative blood film. The most likely differential diagnosis for this patient therefore is hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS). HMS is the most common cause of massive splenomegaly in tropical areas with stable malaria transmission.

An HIV test should be ordered in any patient from Africa with a history of fever and/or thrombocytopenia. Serologies for schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis should be done and blood cultures taken for Brucella species and bacterial endocarditis.
