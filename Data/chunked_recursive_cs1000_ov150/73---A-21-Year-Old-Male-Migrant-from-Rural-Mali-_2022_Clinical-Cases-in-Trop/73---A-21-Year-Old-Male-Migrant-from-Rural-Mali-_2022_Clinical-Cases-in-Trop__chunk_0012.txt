Even though commonly quoted in the literature, Fakunle's criteria are of limited practical use for clinicians practicing in resource-constrained settings, where HMS is naturally most common because malaria serology and IgM levels are usually unavailable. Under those circumstances, clinicians are often limited to presumptive treatment with antimalarials of a patient with massive splenomegaly, and HMS may be difficult to differentiate from lymphoma.

Patients most commonly present with symptoms of anaemia and abdominal heaviness or discomfort, some report episodes of low-grade fever. Full blood count usually shows anaemia, bi- or pancytopenia reflecting hypersplenism. Malaria microscopy is usually negative, because parasitaemia is kept at bay and therefore very low. However, molecular methods such as PCR may be able to detect low-level parasitaemia, as highlighted in this case.
