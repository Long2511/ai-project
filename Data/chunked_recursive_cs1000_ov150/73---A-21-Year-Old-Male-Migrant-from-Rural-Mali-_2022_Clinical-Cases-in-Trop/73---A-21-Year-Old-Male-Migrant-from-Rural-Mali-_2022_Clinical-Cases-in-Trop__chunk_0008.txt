For HMS, malaria PCR should be ordered and antimalarial treatment attempted. If splenomegaly remains unexplained, a bone marrow aspirate should be done to rule out a haematological disorder and look for intracellular Leishmania promastigotes.

HIV serology was negative; EBV and CMV serologies indicated previous infection. Serologies for schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis were also negative, and the blood culture did not yield any pathogens. There were no ova of S. mansoni found in the stool.

Despite the negative blood film, PCR for P. falciparum came back positive, making a diagnosis of hyperreactive splenomegaly very likely.

The patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and the reported episodes of fever subsided. Malaria PCR was still positive at follow-up 2 weeks later, but has remained negative since then.
