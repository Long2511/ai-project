A 21-year old migrant from rural Mali presents with massive splenomegaly, causing a feeling of heaviness in his abdomen and reports intermittent fever. The symptoms have been present for some time.

At presentation he appears well and is afebrile. Gross splenomegaly is the only abnormal finding confirmed by ultrasound, which otherwise yields no pathological results. Laboratory results show mild bicytopenia, normal LDH and almost 4-fold increased immunoglobulin M (IgM). The systemic inflammatory markers are not elevated. Blood films for malaria parasites are negative, but malaria serology is positive.

Lymphoma or leukaemia is an important differential diagnosis to have in a patient with splenomegaly and fever anywhere in the world. However, in our patient it seems unlikely, because the differential count is normal, LDH, CRP and ESR are not elevated and the specialist work-up elsewhere did not yield a cause for his complaints.
