African tick-bite fever (ATBF) is the second most common specific cause of fever after malaria in travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the spotted fever group of rickettsioses, a large group of infections, which are mainly transmitted by ticks. Rickettsial infections are grouped by their transmission vectors. The tick-borne infections are known as spotted fevers and fall under the Spotted Fever (SF) Group. These are caused by various pathogens such as R. africae for African tick bite fever and R. rickettsii for Rocky Mountain SF, are transmitted by ticks, and have reservoirs in mammals, rodents, and marsupials. The mite-borne infections, such as scrub typhus, belong to the Scrub typhus Group. They are caused by the pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi, transmitted by Trombiculid mites, and their reservoirs are rodents and the mites themselves via transovarian transmission. The louse-borne infection is epidemic typhus, which is part of the Typhus Group
