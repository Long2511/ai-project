The incubation period following the bite of an infected tick is about 6 to 10 days. Patients develop fever and flu-like symptoms such as myalgias and headache. There may be a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. It may however take some time for the pathognomonic eschar to demarcate and early lesions may be non-specific erythematous papules, resembling mosquito bites. Multiple inoculation eschars are not uncommon, because Amblyomma ticks are known to aggressively attack their hosts.

Despite the fact that African tick-bite fever belongs to the group of 'spotted fevers', a rash is seen in less than half of cases. ATBF is usually a mild illness and no deaths have been reported so far.

However, neurological involvement has been described in ATBF, including encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Also, retinitis and panuveitis have been described.
