ATBF is caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by cattle ticks of the genus Amblyomma, which act both as reservoir and as vector.

Other reservoir hosts are wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, buffalos, rhinos, and hippos. ATBF is endemic in most of rural sub-Saharan Africa and in the West Indies.

ATBF commonly occurs in game hunters, safari tourists, cross-country runners and campers in veld areas or grasslands. ATBF is one of the most common causes of febrile presentations in international travellers to sub-Saharan Africa, and it is the most common rickettsial infection encountered in travel medicine. In contrast, fairly little is known about incidence and risk factors of ATBF in local indigenous populations.
