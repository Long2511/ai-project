Diagnosis of ATBF is usually made clinically, but in febrile individuals living in or returning from tropical areas malaria should still be ruled out.

PCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is a non-invasive and sensitive way to confirm the diagnosis of acute infection. Serodiagnosis remains the gold standard for spotted-fever group rickettsial infections using seroconversion and fourfold antibody titre increases. Its use in clinical decision-making is however limited because of poor sensitivity during acute infection (antibodies are often not detectable within the first 10-14 days), the indirect nature of diagnostic evidence and cross-reaction with other Rickettsiae. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is currently considered the gold standard serological test.

Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases. Doxycycline 100 mg bid PO may be given for 3 to 7 days. In pregnant women and in children younger than 8 years of age, macrolides are an alternative.
