A 52-year-old man presents to a tropical medicine clinic in Germany with a fever for the past 2 days. He is also complaining of night sweats and a frontal headache. There are no joint pains and he has not noticed a rash.

Ten days ago, he returned from a 2-week holiday trip to South Africa. He visited Cape Town and travelled the Garden Route and through KwaZulu-Natal. He went on safari in Kruger Park and several other game reserves. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. His past medical history is unremarkable.

Fair general condition. Tympanic temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F) (after taking 1g of paracetamol), pulse 80bpm, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg.

No jaundice; neck supple. Enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin. You notice a small sticking plaster on the left upper thigh of the patient. He tells you that he has noted a skin lesion that he meant to show to a friend, who happens to be a surgeon, for advice. You ask the patient to take off the plaster.
