The diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical.

A PCR from the eschar scab may confirm the diagnosis. For confirmative serology, paired samples would have to be taken and may be more of academic value in this case. African tick-bite fever is usually a mild, self-limiting disease. Doxycycline can be given to speed up recovery.

The malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin film for malaria, came back negative. The patient was prescribed doxycycline at 100 mg bid PO for 1 week. The fever settled within the next few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after about 2 weeks.
