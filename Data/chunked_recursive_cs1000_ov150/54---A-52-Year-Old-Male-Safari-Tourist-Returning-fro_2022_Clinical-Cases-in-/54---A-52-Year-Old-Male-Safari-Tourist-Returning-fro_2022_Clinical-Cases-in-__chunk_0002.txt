A 52-year-old German man presents with a short history of fever after a trip to South Africa. On examination there is a small necrotic skin lesion on his upper thigh with adjoining lymphangiitis and lymphadenitis.

The skin lesion is a typical eschar. Given the travel history, the clinical diagnosis is most likely African tick-bite fever. This rickettsial disease is a common cause of fever in safari tourists returning from Southern Africa.

The patient has travelled to KwaZulu-Natal, which is a malaria-endemic region, and he has not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In any febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region, malaria has to be ruled out, even if other diagnoses seem obvious.

The diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical.
