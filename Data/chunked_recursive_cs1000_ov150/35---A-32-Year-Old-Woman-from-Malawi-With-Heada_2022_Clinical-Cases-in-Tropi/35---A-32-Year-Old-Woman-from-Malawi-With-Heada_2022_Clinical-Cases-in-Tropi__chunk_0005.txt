A lumbar puncture was done on admission. The CSF looked clear, but the opening pressure was increased at 50 cmH2O (normal: 10-18 cmH2O). The CSF results on admission revealed a leukocyte count of 18 cells/µL, which is above the reference of 0-5. The protein level was elevated at 0.8 g/L, compared to the reference range of 0.15-0.40, while the glucose level was low at 1.97 mmol/L, below the reference of 2.22-3.88. The India Ink test was negative, matching the reference, but the culture was positive for C. neoformans.
A diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made based upon a positive fungal culture result. India Ink was negative, but sensitivity is only at around 50–70%. CrAg, which is >95% sensitive, was not available.
The HIV serology came back positive. The CD4 count was very low at 22/µL. The patient was started on oral fluconazole 1200 mg, because the preferred fungicidal drugs Amphotericin B and flucytosine were not available.
