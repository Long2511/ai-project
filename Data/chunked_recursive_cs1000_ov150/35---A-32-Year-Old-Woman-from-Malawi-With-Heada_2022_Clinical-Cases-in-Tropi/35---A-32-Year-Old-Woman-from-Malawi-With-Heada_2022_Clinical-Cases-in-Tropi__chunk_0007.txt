Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) occurs worldwide. Ninety-five per cent of CM cases in developing countries are HIV-associated. CM is the most common cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high.
Cryptococcal meningitis is caused by the encapsulated environmental yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. It is an opportunistic infection, which occurs at advanced stages of immunosuppression, in HIV mostly at CD4 counts below 100/µL. Patients usually present with a sub-acute headache of several days to weeks duration. Other common clinical findings are cranial nerve palsies (N VI), confusion and impaired consciousness. Altered mental state is associated with increased lethality. CM is clinically indistinguishable from tuberculous meningitis (TBM), although fever and neck stiffness are more common in TBM.
