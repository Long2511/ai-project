CSF opening pressure is often markedly elevated. Further CSF findings are commonly non-specific, and the CSF may even be normal. Diagnosis of CM is made by demonstrating the fungus in the CSF. This is traditionally done by light microscopy after India-Ink staining, but this method is user-dependent and the sensitivity is therefore variable. Detection of CrAg e.g. by latex-agglutination test or lateral flow assay (LFA) is better. Fungal culture of CSF is required to isolate the organism for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CM treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. The gold standard is an induction therapy with two fungicidal drugs that rapidly decrease the fungal burden in the CSF i.e. combined (liposomal) amphotericin B plus flucytosine (IV or oral) for the initial 2 weeks, followed by oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for at least 8 weeks and fluconazole maintenance therapy 200 mg daily until immune reconstitution.
