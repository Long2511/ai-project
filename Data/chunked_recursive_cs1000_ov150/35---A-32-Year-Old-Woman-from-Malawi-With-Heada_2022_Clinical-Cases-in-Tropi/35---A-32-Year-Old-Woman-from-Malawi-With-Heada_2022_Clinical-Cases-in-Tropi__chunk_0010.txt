Many patients with CM suffer from severe headaches, which do not respond to analgesics. The headache is caused by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and therapeutic lumbar punctures (LPs) bring immediate pain relief. LPs may have to be repeated on a daily basis until the ICP has come down and sustained pain control has been achieved.
HIV-positive patients with CM should start antiretroviral therapy, but the optimum timing is not yet clear. Introduction of ART 4 to 10 weeks after starting antifungal treatment is currently considered the safest approach.
Prognosis of CM in resource-limited settings is poor and 10-week lethality on fluconazole monotherapy may exceed 60%.
