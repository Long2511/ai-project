The reality in many resource-limited settings is however hampered by poor drug availability and therefore commonly differs from the gold standard. Oral fluconazole is often the only available drug, thanks to a drug donation programme by the manufacturing company. Fluconazole is only fungistatic, which may be effective as a secondary prophylaxis, but is less useful as induction therapy when potent fungicidal drugs are needed to rapidly bring down the fungal burden. Studies in low-income settings have demonstrated that even short courses of Amphotericin B (5-7 days) are preferable to treatment with fluconazole alone. Flucytosine, the other fungicidal drug, is expensive; and despite its great value in the treatment of CM, remains unlicensed in many African and Asian countries. Steroids are of no benefit in the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.
