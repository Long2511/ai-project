A 32-year-old Malawian woman presents to a local hospital with a 3-week history of headache and blurred vision. The headache has been gradual in onset and does not respond to over-the-counter painkillers. There is no fever and no history of convulsions or of head trauma.
The patient presented to a local health centre where she received presumptive antimalarial treatment (artemether/lumefantrine) and a course of antibiotics (amoxicillin 500 mg tds for 5 days), which was of no benefit.

The patient appears wasted and slightly anaemic. All vital signs are normal and she is afebrile. The GCS is 15/15. There is no neck stiffness. The visual acuity is normal on both sides. On left lateral gaze there is an abduction deficit of the left eye with 'blurring of vision' reported by the patient. The rest of the examination is normal.
