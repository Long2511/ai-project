The patient's clinical presentation suggests chronic meningitis. The two most important differential diagnoses are cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculous meningitis. Also, partially treated bacterial meningitis is a possibility because she received amoxicillin at the health centre, but the gradual onset of symptoms makes this less likely.

Chronic meningitis is commonly associated with immunosuppression. The patient lives in a part of the world with a high HIV prevalence. Her laboratory findings (anaemia and thrombocytopenia) are also common in untreated HIV infection.
Even though malaria may present with non-specific symptoms and both thrombocytopenia and anaemia are commonly seen in malaria patients, the absence of fever, the negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the history of taking artemisinin combination therapy make it an unlikely differential diagnosis. Also, malaria usually does not cause cranial nerve palsies.
