The differential diagnosis is wide, but by some distance the most common cause of fever and jaundice or fever and confusion in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. The fact that the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a reason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in malaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at presentation. A common misdiagnosis is acute viral hepatitis; there, fever precedes the jaundice, and this rapid fulminant course would not be typical. Other causes of acute fever and jaundice include typhoid fever, leptospirosis and ascending cholangitis. Patients with advanced HIV disease and Gram-negative sepsis can also present like this.

People returning from visiting friends and relatives constitute a large proportion of imported malaria and are at high risk of not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. A woman born in Europe would be unlikely to have any immunity to malaria.
