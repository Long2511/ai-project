The patient was found to have a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18% and a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L (reference range 45–90 µmol/L), demonstrating acute kidney injury. Urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, therefore pre-renal failure could be ruled out. She was treated with intravenous artesunate and the parasite count dropped to 5% but she lapsed into deep coma. Renal function deteriorated and she needed haemofiltration. After the parasites had cleared on day 5, her consciousness level began to improve, but she developed laboured breathing. The chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS, and she required prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.
