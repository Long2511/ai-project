Malaria is the most common life-threatening infection in patients who have recently arrived from Africa. It is also common, but much less so, from South and South-east Asia (Fig. 22.1). A history of fever is usual in non-immune patients, but other features of the presentation are non-specific and overlap with many other infections, with headache and malaise. Malaria should always be high on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics, because there are many misleading presentations.

The only way to exclude malaria is a malaria blood test. Diagnosed early before complications begin, falciparum malaria is relatively easily treated with antimalarial drug combinations. In patients with severe malaria, artesunate is the drug of choice; if this is not available locally, artemether or quinine are the alternatives.
