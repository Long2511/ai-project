The laboratory is right to raise VHF as a possible diagnosis, but VHF is very rare and 18 days (or more) since leaving the high-risk area is on the outer limit of the incubation period of Lassa fever and other VHF (generally up to 21 days). The absence of injected sclerae or rash is also against the diagnosis. A malaria blood film would be mandatory in this case. If it is positive, the woman could be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions.
