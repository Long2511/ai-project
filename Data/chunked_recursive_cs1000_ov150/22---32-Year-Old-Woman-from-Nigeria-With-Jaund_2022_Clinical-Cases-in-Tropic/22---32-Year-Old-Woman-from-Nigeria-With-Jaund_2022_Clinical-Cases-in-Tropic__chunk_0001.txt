A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent born in Europe, travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. According to her husband, 18 days after her return to Europe she developed a fever, and 3 days later became very unwell with abnormal behaviour.

On examination she has a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), is mildly jaundiced and confused; her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15. She has no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and throat and sclerae are not injected. She has some fine crepitations at the lung bases.

The laboratory refuses to undertake tests because of recent rural exposure in an area known to have viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa).

A young woman presents with a fever, jaundice and confusion almost 3 weeks after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The patient is of African ethnicity but was born in Europe.
