Treatment failure occurs in almost one quarter of patients after a first course of SSG monotherapy in Peruvian series, usually within 3 months. Follow-up is therefore recommended. Factors linked to treatment failure include young age and short stay in endemic area (as in this case) as well as recent onset of disease (<5 weeks), multiple lesions, and L. (V.) braziliensis infection. At the third month of follow-up, our patient did not have any signs of relapse.
