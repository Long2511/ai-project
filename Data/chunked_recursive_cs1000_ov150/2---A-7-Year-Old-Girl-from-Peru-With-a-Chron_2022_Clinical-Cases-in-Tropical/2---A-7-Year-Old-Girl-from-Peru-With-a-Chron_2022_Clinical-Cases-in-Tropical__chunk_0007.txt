If leishmaniasis is ruled out, the following tests can be useful for the diagnosis of alternative causes of our patient's lesion: smear microscopy and culture in Sabouraud's medium (for sporotrichosis), a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (for tuberculosis) and, if necessary, a histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen.

The scab was removed revealing an ulcer with cobblestone-patterned bottom and raised edges, typical of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The microscopic examination of a sample obtained by scraping was negative. The leishmanin skin test was positive. PCR was also positive; and the infecting species was identified as Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana.
