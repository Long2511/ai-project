Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a common, vector-borne, parasitic disease that affects people living in or travelling to endemic areas. It typically begins as a small papule on air-exposed parts of the skin, progresses to a nodule or plaque and then turns into an ulcer with raised borders. The ulcer is painless unless there is bacterial superinfection. Patients may have several lesions.

Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus that is found in soil and on plants. It enters the skin through direct inoculation (e.g. thorny plants or animal scratch). The disease usually starts with a papule that turns into a tender ulcer. Lesions can spread along draining lymphatic vessels. Sporotrichosis occurs throughout the world as a sporadic disease of farmers and gardeners. This disease is hyperendemic in parts of the Peruvian Andes, where it often affects children and typically produces facial lesions. However, our patient did not travel to such a hyperendemic place.
