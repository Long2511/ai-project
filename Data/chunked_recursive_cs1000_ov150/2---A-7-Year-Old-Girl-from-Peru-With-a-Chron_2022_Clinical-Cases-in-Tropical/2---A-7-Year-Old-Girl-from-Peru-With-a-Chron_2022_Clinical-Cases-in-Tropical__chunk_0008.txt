With a definitive diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis, treatment was started with intravenous sodium stibogluconate (SSG, 20 mg/kg/day for 20 days) which is the first-line treatment of choice for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (V.) braziliensis or L. (V.) peruviana in Peru. In addition, the girl received topical imiquimod therapy, which was administered every other day for 20 days. Imiquimod, is an immune-modulating drug, which may be used as part of the therapy for facial lesions and relapses. The response after 20 days of treatment was good.
