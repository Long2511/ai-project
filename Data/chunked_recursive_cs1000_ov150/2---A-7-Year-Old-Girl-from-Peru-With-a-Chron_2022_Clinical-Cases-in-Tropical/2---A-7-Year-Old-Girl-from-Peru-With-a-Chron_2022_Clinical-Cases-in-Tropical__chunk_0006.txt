The simplest approach is to scrape with a lancet under the edges of the lesion, and use the obtained material for a smear examination with Giemsa staining, looking for Leishmania amastigotes. The sensitivity of this technique is about 70%, decreasing as the duration of the lesion increases. The specificity is 100%.

Culture can be done on samples obtained by fine-needle aspiration or biopsy taken from the edge of a lesion. In reference centres, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to confirm the presence of Leishmania and to identify the species.

The Montenegro or leishmanin skin test detects delayed immune response against Leishmania antigens and is sometimes used as a diagnostic aid. It can be negative in early stages of the disease and cannot distinguish current from past infection.
