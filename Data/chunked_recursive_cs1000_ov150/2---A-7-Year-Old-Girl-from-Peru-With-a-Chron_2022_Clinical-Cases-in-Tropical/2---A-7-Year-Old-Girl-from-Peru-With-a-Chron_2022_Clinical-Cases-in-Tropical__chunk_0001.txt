A 7-year-old girl who lives in the Peruvian capital, Lima, is brought to a local clinic because of a chronic skin lesion on her nose. The lesion appeared 4 months ago as a small nodule and slowly turned into an ulcer. It is a bit itchy but not painful. There is no history of trauma. The girl is otherwise healthy. Six months ago, she travelled to a valley on the western slopes of the Andes.

The lesion is a localized ulcer on the nose. The borders of the ulcer are indurated and there is a plaque-like infiltration of the surrounding skin. The whole lesion is about 2 cm in diameter. There are no palpable lymph nodes. She is afebrile and the rest of the physical examination is normal.

A 7-year-old Peruvian girl presents with a painless ulcerative skin lesion on her nose, which has been present for the past 4 months. There are no systemic symptoms.
