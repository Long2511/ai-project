The treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is challenging because SSG has a high failure rate and several side effects, including myalgia, arthralgia, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, increased levels of liver and pancreatic enzymes, reactivation of varicella zoster virus and cardiotoxicity, which can lead to prolongation of QT-segment, severe arrhythmias and death. Information about the safety of this drug in children is limited. It is also unclear from the literature if there are safe and effective alternatives to SSG in children with L. (V.) peruviana infection. This is particularly relevant because, in endemic areas, cutaneous leishmaniasis often affects children.
