Infectious diseases that can cause similar lesions in the face are cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living amoeba.

Although common bacterial infections of the skin that are partially treated or masked as a consequence of traditional remedies (e.g. chemical burns) are another possibility; this is less likely in our case given the chronic nature of the lesion. Cutaneous anthrax and tularaemia could be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions located on the extremities, but the latter is endemic in the Northern hemisphere only, and the long duration without any further symptoms does not fit with either infection. In addtion, cutaneous anthrax tends to present with considerable localized oedema not seen in this case.
