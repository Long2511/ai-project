Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon manifestation of tuberculosis. It occurs by direct inoculation of mycobacteria into the skin of non-sensitized individuals (e.g. children) or as a result of reactivation in persons with previous immunity against mycobacteria. As our patient lives in a poor neighbourhood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, we cannot rule out this diagnosis. Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions.
