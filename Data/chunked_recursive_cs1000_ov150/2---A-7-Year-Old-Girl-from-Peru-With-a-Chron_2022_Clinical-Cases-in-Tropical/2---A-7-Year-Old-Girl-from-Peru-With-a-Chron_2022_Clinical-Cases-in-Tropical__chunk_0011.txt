Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Some 20 Leishmania species are associated with human disease. CL can be anthroponotic or zoonotic (reservoir: small mammals). The parasite is transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia (New World) and Phlebotomus (Old World). Of the estimated 1.5 million annual cases, 90% occur in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia and Peru.

The incubation period between sand fly bite and appearance of skin lesions ranges from weeks to months. Clinical manifestations depend on characteristics of the parasite and the host immune response. Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form. Some species of the Leishmania Viannia-complex can produce mucosal lesions resulting in disfiguring disease.
