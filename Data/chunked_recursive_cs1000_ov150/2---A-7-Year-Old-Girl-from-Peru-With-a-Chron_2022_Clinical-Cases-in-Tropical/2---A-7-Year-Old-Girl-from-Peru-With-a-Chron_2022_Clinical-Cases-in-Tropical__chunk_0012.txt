The lesions can heal spontaneously; this is more common in Old World (>50%) than in New World leishmaniasis (<20%). The aim of treatment is to accelerate healing, reduce scarring and decrease the risk of metastasis and recurrence. Topical therapy is recommended for Old World CL and for New World CL caused by species not belonging to the Leishmania Viannia-complex. This topical approach consists of intralesional pentavalent antimony, paromomycin cream and/or cryo- or thermotherapy. Systemic therapy is indicated for CL caused by species of the Leishmania (Viannia)-complex, which may lead to disfiguring mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In addition, systemic treatment should be given when lesions are extensive or when topical treatment fails. Pentavalent antimonials are the first-line systemic treatment of choice for all New World forms except L. guyanensis, for which pentamidine is recommended. Miltefosine and azoles are alternatives
