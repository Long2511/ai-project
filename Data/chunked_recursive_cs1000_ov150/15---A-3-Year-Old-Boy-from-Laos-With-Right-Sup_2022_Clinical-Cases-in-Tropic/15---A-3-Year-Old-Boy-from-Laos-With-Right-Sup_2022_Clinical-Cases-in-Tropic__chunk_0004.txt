Mumps was the commonest cause of parotid swelling in children until the introduction of vaccination, which is still not commonly available in some countries, including Laos. Swelling is painful, but is non-suppurative and becomes bilateral in the majority of cases. Other less common viral agents causing parotitis include parainfluenza viruses, influenza A, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and enteroviruses, but these do not cause the degree of inflammation and suppuration seen here.

Granulomatous parotitis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and other mycobacteria, is rare and presents with a more chronic, painless, enlarging mass without surrounding inflammation. Salivary stones and malignancies are very rare in children.
