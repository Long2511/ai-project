The laboratory must be informed if melioidosis is suspected, because selective media are used to isolate B. pseudomallei from non-sterile sites, and suspected growth must be handled under containment level 3 conditions when available.

If melioidosis is confirmed, investigations should look for underlying predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, although these are found less commonly in children with B. pseudomallei parotitis than in adults with melioidosis.

Pus culture from the right ear and parotid abscess isolated B. pseudomallei. Blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.
