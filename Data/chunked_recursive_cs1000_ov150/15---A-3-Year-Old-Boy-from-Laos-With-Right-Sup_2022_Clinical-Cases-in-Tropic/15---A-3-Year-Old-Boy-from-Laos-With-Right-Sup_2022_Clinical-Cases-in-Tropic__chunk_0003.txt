Acute, suppurative, unilateral parotitis in children is usually bacterial. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, although the latter has declined because of widespread vaccination. Neonates are at risk of parotitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, and Streptococcus pneumoniae parotitis may occur in HIV-infected children.

In an endemic area like Laos, Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, must also be considered. Studies in neighbouring countries have shown melioidosis to be the commonest cause of suppurative parotitis in children. Actinomycosis and cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae) are more unusual bacterial causes.
