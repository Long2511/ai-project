Samples for bacterial culture before commencing antimicrobial therapy are crucial. Gram stain and bacterial culture of pus from the ear are quick and non-invasive. Blood cultures should be taken because the results have therapeutic and prognostic implications.

A throat swab may detect causative bacterial pathogens and has been used to diagnose melioidosis in children. Deep pus from incision and drainage of the parotid abscess is the most useful diagnostic material, and drainage may be necessary for management of the abscess. This may be performed under ultrasound guidance.

Full blood count may help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes. When melioidosis is suspected, chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound should be requested to look for other foci of infection. In this patient a radiograph of the skull would be useful to detect any osteomyelitis.
