The child looks unwell, with a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F). There is a localized, fluctuant, hot, tender swelling below and anterior to the right ear, 6 to 8 cm in diameter, extending from the lower cheek to the submandibular region and consistent with a parotid mass. Ear examination reveals a purulent discharge in the auditory canal and suspicion of a small fistula from which the pus is arising, with a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat are unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy and no hepatosplenomegaly. Heart sounds are normal and the chest is clear.

The white blood cell count was 16.5 ×10⁹/L, with 90% neutrophils, compared to a normal range of 4–10 x10⁹/L. Hemoglobin was 9.4g/dL, compared to a normal range of 13-15g/dL. All other blood tests are normal.

A 3-year-old boy from rural Laos presents to a local hospital because of high fever, unilateral parotid swelling and purulent discharge from his ear. The little boy has previously been well.
