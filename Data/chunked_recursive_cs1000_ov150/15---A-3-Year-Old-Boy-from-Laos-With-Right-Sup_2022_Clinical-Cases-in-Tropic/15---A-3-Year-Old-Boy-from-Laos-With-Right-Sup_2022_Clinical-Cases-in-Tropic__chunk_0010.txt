The aims of treatment are to reduce mortality and morbidity, prevent recurrence and drain abscesses. Referral to a surgeon for consideration for drainage should be arranged; however, such surgery risks damage to the facial nerve. There is little evidence to inform the choice and duration of antimicrobial treatment for localized melioidosis in children. The authors recommend precautionary intravenous ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem for the acute phase (10–14 days); however, parenteral therapy is very expensive. This is followed by co-trimoxazole monotherapy for the eradication phase (12–20 weeks), which has been shown to be non-inferior to dual therapy with co-trimoxazole and doxycycline and avoids adverse effects of doxycycline in children. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is an alternative for patients with sulfa allergy or resistance and in pregnancy.
