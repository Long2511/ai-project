In endemic areas B. pseudomallei is readily isolated from soil and surface water. The disease is highly seasonal and most cases present during the rainy season.

The clinical presentation ranges from mild localized infection to severe septicaemia. In endemic areas, 60–80% of children have evidence of seroconversion to B. pseudomallei by the age of 4 years and most paediatric infections are mild or asymptomatic.

Septicaemic melioidosis occurs in more than one-third of paediatric cases, with a similar clinical presentation as in adults. The lung is the most common organ involved, and septic shock is associated with a high mortality. Multiple organ involvement and disseminated infections are well described. Localized disease, however, accounts for the majority of paediatric melioidosis, with the parotid gland being the most common site involved. Skin and soft tissue abscesses are also common. Parotitis is uncommon in adults and has not been seen in children in Australia.
