The patient had incision and drainage of the parotid with removal of copious pus. Intravenous ceftazidime was administered for 10 days followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks with good clinical response. No complications occurred, and no underlying disease was identified. Being from a rice farming family, the boy was likely to have been frequently exposed to soil and water containing B. pseudomallei in the paddy fields.

Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by B. pseudomallei, a saprophytic Gram-negative environmental bacterium endemic in South and South-east Asia, as well as in northern Australia. It is the third most common cause of death in north-east Thailand after HIV and tuberculosis. There is growing evidence that melioidosis is also of relevance in other parts of the tropics where its importance has long been underestimated.
