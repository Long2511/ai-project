Adverse effects with co-trimoxazole are common and usually occur at 6 to 14 days of treatment, e.g. cytopaenias (40%), rash (25%), fever (20%) and abnormal liver profile (10%). Second-line treatment is with primaquine and clindamycin or IV pentamidine. For mild-to-moderate cases, dapsone-trimethoprim or atovaquone may be given.

In resource-limited settings alternative treatments are mostly unavailable. In case of a mild rash, the only option may be desensitization with cautious re-exposure to co-trimoxazole.

Secondary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (480mg or 960 mg od) should be given until a CD4 count over 200/μL has been maintained for at least 3 months after commencing ART.

In some resource-limited tropical countries, co-trimoxazole is continued life-long.
