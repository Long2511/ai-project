The severity of Pneumocystis Pneumonia is graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases present with increasing exertional dyspnoea, with or without cough and sweats; on room air, the PaO2 is normal but SaO2 falls on exercise, and chest radiography is normal or shows minor perihilar infiltrates. Moderate cases involve dyspnoea on minimal exertion, occasional dyspnoea at rest, fever, and sweats; the PaO2 on room air is between 8.1 and 11 kPa, and chest radiography shows diffuse interstitial shadowing. Severe cases are characterized by dyspnoea and tachypnoea at rest, along with persistent fever and cough; the PaO2 on room air is less than 8.0 kPa, and chest radiography reveals extensive interstitial shadowing with diffuse alveolar shadowing, often described as a 'white out' that spares the costophrenic angles and apices.
