Bronchoscopy was macroscopically normal. Grocott staining of BAL fluid revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms, and PCR was strongly positive for P. jirovecii DNA. Oxygen was gradually weaned and the patient was discharged on oral co-trimoxazole to complete a 21-day total course. Ten days into PCP treatment, the patient commenced antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz. Two weeks into PCP treatment, he developed a widespread pruritic maculopapular rash most likely attributable to either co-trimoxazole or efavirenz. As a result, co-trimoxazole was changed to clindamycin and primaquine for the final week of treatment and efavirenz was replaced by a boosted protease inhibitor. After completing PCP treatment, he was started on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.
