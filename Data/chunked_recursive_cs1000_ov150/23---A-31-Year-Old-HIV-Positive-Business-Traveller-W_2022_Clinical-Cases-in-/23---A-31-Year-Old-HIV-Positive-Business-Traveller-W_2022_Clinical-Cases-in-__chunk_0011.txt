Grading of severity at presentation guides management decisions (Table 23.2). Diagnosis is by visualizing P. jirovecii on BAL fluid (>90% sensitivity, and sensitivity maintained up to 10 days into treatment). Induced sputum has lower sensitivity (50-90%). PCR of respiratory secretions cannot reliably distinguish infection from colonization. Chest imaging can support the diagnosis, but changes are non-specific and the chest radiograph may be normal. The classic finding is of diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates. High-resolution CT scan may show diffuse or patchy "ground-glass" infiltrates. A normal CT scan has a high negative predictive value for PCP.
