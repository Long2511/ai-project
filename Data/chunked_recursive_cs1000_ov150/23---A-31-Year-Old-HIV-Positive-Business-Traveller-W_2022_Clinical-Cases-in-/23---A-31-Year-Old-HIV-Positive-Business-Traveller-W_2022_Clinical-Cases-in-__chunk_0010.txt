P. jirovecii, a fungus found worldwide, causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised individuals. Classic symptoms are sub-acute onset of malaise, non-productive cough and progressive exertional dyspnoea; fever may also be present. On examination, desaturation on exertion is the classic sign; this is a useful clinical test in resource- limited settings because it is easy to perform using a simple pulse oximeter.

The chest is often clear on auscultation. Complications include respiratory failure and pneumothorax. Without treatment, PCP is progressive and usually fatal.
