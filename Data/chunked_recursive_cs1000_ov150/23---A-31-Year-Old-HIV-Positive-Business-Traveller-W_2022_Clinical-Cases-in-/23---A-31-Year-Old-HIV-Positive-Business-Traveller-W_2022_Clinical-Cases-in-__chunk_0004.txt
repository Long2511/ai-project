Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) should be high up in the differential of any ART-naïve, HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count, who presents with progressive shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough, with patchy perihilar infiltrates on the chest radiograph. Tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis should also be considered. Serum 1,3 β-D-glucan (β-glucan) is frequently elevated in patients with PCP. Although the β-glucan assay has a high sensitivity for PCP, the specificity of an elevated β-glucan for PCP diagnosis is low because other fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, some drugs including amoxicillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, and cellulose membranes used for haemodialysis can elevate β-glucan levels. Bronchoscopy and immunofluorescence or Grocott methenamine silver staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are the diagnostic tests of choice
