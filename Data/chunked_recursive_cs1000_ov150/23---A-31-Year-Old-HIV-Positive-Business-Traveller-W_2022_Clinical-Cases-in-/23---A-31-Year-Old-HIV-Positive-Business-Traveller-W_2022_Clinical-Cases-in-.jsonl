He has a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reports general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10kg over the past 5 months.\nHe travels extensively for business and in the past 6 months has had work trips to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore and the United States. He lives with his male partner, denies any recreational drug use and has never smoked tobacco. He was diagnosed with HIV 6 years ago. He says that 1 month ago his CD4 was 280/μL. He is not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART), nor on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis or any other regular medications. There is no other significant past medical history."}

Tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis should also be considered. Serum 1,3 β-D-glucan (β-glucan) is frequently elevated in patients with PCP. Although the β-glucan assay has a high sensitivity for PCP, the specificity of an elevated β-glucan for PCP diagnosis is low because other fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, some drugs including amoxicillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, and cellulose membranes used for haemodialysis can elevate β-glucan levels. Bronchoscopy and immunofluorescence or Grocott methenamine silver staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are the diagnostic tests of choice"}

Similar staining of induced sputum is a less sensitive alternative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly sensitive and specific for detecting Pneumocystis in BAL fluid or induced sputum. However, PCR cannot reliably distinguish colonization from active disease, although higher organism loads, as determined by quantitative PCR, likely represent clinically significant disease.

Some patients will require CPAP or ventilatory support in addition to oxygen therapy. High-dose co-trimoxazole is first-line treatment for PCP; this may be given IV in severe respiratory failure or if the patient is unable to tolerate oral therapy. In moderate to severe PCP corticosteroids should be added. Standard starting dose is prednisolone 40 mg bid or methylprednisolone 30 mg bid, IV if unable to tolerate PO."}

Mild cases present with increasing exertional dyspnoea, with or without cough and sweats; on room air, the PaO2 is normal but SaO2 falls on exercise, and chest radiography is normal or shows minor perihilar infiltrates. Moderate cases involve dyspnoea on minimal exertion, occasional dyspnoea at rest, fever, and sweats; the PaO2 on room air is between 8.1 and 11 kPa, and chest radiography shows diffuse interstitial shadowing. Severe cases are characterized by dyspnoea and tachypnoea at rest, along with persistent fever and cough; the PaO2 on room air is less than 8.0 kPa, and chest radiography reveals extensive interstitial shadowing with diffuse alveolar shadowing, often described as a 'white out' that spares the costophrenic angles and apices."}

Grocott staining of BAL fluid revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms, and PCR was strongly positive for P. jirovecii DNA. Oxygen was gradually weaned and the patient was discharged on oral co-trimoxazole to complete a 21-day total course. Ten days into PCP treatment, the patient commenced antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz. Two weeks into PCP treatment, he developed a widespread pruritic maculopapular rash most likely attributable to either co-trimoxazole or efavirenz. As a result, co-trimoxazole was changed to clindamycin and primaquine for the final week of treatment and efavirenz was replaced by a boosted protease inhibitor. After completing PCP treatment, he was started on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis."}

Classic symptoms are sub-acute onset of malaise, non-productive cough and progressive exertional dyspnoea; fever may also be present. On examination, desaturation on exertion is the classic sign; this is a useful clinical test in resource- limited settings because it is easy to perform using a simple pulse oximeter.\n\nThe chest is often clear on auscultation. Complications include respiratory failure and pneumothorax. Without treatment, PCP is progressive and usually fatal."}

Diagnosis is by visualizing P. jirovecii on BAL fluid (>90% sensitivity, and sensitivity maintained up to 10 days into treatment). Induced sputum has lower sensitivity (50-90%). PCR of respiratory secretions cannot reliably distinguish infection from colonization. Chest imaging can support the diagnosis, but changes are non-specific and the chest radiograph may be normal. The classic finding is of diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates. High-resolution CT scan may show diffuse or patchy \"ground-glass\" infiltrates. A normal CT scan has a high negative predictive value for PCP."}

The addition of high-dose corticosteroids in moderate to severe PCP improves outcomes if started within 72 hours of starting specific PCP treatment. In HIV-positive patients co-trimoxazole should be continued for a total of 21 days; in other types of immunosuppression 14 days may be sufficient. Steroids are weaned over 20 days. ART should be started within the first 14 days of PCP treatment in ART-naïve, HIV-positive patients.\n\nIn resource-limited settings, the diagnosis of PCP is most commonly made on clinical grounds. Differentiating PCP from pulmonary TB is often challenging, and dual infections with both TB and PCP also need to be considered. In the absence of intensive care options severely ill patients may have to be empirically treated for both infections. Co-trimoxazole is often available as an oral formulation only."}

For mild-to-moderate cases, dapsone-trimethoprim or atovaquone may be given.\n\nIn resource-limited settings alternative treatments are mostly unavailable. In case of a mild rash, the only option may be desensitization with cautious re-exposure to co-trimoxazole.\n\nSecondary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (480mg or 960 mg od) should be given until a CD4 count over 200/μL has been maintained for at least 3 months after commencing ART.\n\nIn some resource-limited tropical countries, co-trimoxazole is continued life-long."}
