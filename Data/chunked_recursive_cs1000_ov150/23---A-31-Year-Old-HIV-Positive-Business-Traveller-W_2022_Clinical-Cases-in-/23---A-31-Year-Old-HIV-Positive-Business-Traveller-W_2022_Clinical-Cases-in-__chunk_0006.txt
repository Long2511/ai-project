Correction of hypoxia aiming for oxygen saturation greater than 95% is top priority. Some patients will require CPAP or ventilatory support in addition to oxygen therapy. High-dose co-trimoxazole is first-line treatment for PCP; this may be given IV in severe respiratory failure or if the patient is unable to tolerate oral therapy. In moderate to severe PCP corticosteroids should be added. Standard starting dose is prednisolone 40 mg bid or methylprednisolone 30 mg bid, IV if unable to tolerate PO.
