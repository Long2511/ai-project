. Ziehl-Neelsen staining of the BAL fluid for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) should also be requested. Similar staining of induced sputum is a less sensitive alternative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly sensitive and specific for detecting Pneumocystis in BAL fluid or induced sputum. However, PCR cannot reliably distinguish colonization from active disease, although higher organism loads, as determined by quantitative PCR, likely represent clinically significant disease. CD4 count should be requested as well.
