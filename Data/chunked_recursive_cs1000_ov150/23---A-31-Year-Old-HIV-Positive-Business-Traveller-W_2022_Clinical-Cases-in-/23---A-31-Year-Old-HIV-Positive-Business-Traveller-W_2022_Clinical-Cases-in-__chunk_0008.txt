The patient was treated with high-flow oxygen and started on high-dose co-trimoxazole plus prednisolone combined with a proton-pump inhibitor. His tachycardia settled with reversal of his hypoxia and he remained otherwise stable. In view of his multiple recent long-haul flights a computed tomography (CT)-pulmonary angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (Fig. 23.2). This showed extensive "ground-glass” infiltrates in both lungs, especially in the lower lobes, but no evidence of pulmonary emboli or cavitations. Serum β-glucan was >500 pg/mL (<80pg/mL).
