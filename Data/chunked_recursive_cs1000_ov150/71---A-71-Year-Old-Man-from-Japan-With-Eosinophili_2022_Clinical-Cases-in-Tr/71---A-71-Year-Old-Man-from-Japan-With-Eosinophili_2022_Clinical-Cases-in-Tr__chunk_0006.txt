Bronchoscopy did not reveal any signs of malignancy. Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for malignant cells and acid-fast bacilli. The QuantiFERON test and a wide range of tumour markers were negative.
In view of the elevated IgE levels, the patient's eosinophilia and the fact that the patient originated from Southern Japan, paragonimiasis was strongly suspected and the patient's serum was submitted for immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases. Multiple-dot ELISA was strongly positive for P. westermani.
The patient was treated with oral praziquantel 25 mg/kg tds for 3 consecutive days. The lung lesion gradually faded and eventually disappeared. His serum antibody titre also declined.
