Clinical features of the disease are similar to those of pulmonary TB or lung cancer. Patients may have chronic cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats and abnormal findings on chest imaging. Pleural effusion with marked eosinophilia in the exudate and pneumothorax without apparent nodular lesion/cavitation may occur in the early stages and/or in light infections.
Extrapulmonary paragonimiasis may present as painless, mobile subcutaneous swellings. Migration into the CNS may lead to acute eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and epilepsy.
However, about 20% of patients are asymptomatic and the disease is accidentally found on routine chest radiography, when nodules, ring shadows or cavities are typically seen.
Eosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection but may be only mild or absent in chronic disease.
