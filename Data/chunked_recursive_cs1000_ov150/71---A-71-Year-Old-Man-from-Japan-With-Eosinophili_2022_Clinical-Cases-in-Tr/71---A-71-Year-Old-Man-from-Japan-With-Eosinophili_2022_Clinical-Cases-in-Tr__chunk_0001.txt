A 71-year-old Japanese man is referred to a local tertiary care hospital for further work-up of a nodular lesion in his right lung. He is clinically well and does not report any complaints.

The lesion was first detected 2 years earlier during a routine health check. Initially it was of linear shape. The patient has been regularly followed up since then. At his most recent follow-up visit it was found by chest radiography and CT scan that his linear lung shadow had turned into a nodular lesion of about 2 cm in diameter.
The patient was born in Kyushu district, southern Japan, where he is still living. He has no history of travelling overseas.

The vital signs were normal. The chest was clear. The remainder of the physical examination was also normal.

His full blood count and total IgE are shown. Liver and renal function tests as well as electrolytes are normal. LDH and CRP are not raised.
