Eosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection but may be only mild or absent in chronic disease.
The definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum, BAL fluid or faeces. However, sensitivity is below 50% in light infections. Instead, an immunodiagnostic screening test such as multiple-dot ELISA should be used in combination with the patient's history and additional laboratory results. Serological tests (e.g. ELISA) may detect early as well as chronic infections, and titres decline rapidly after cure. Praziquantel is the drug of choice. A course of 25 mg/kg tds for 3 consecutive days is usually effective against all Paragonimus species.
