Paragonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by infection with lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Paragonimus westermani is the most widely distributed species in Asia, but several additional species also cause disease. Apart from Asia, paragonimiasis occurs in the Americas and in sub-Saharan Africa.
Adult flukes live in the lungs of a mammalian host (felines, canines, humans). Ova are coughed up and either expectorated or swallowed and passed in the faeces. When eggs reach fresh water, miracidia hatch and infect a snail (first intermediate host). After asexual multiplication, cercariae are released and infect a crab or crayfish (second intermediate host).
