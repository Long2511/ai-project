When suspecting lung fluke infection, it is important to find out if the patient may at any time have been exposed to this parasite. Paragonimus species are endemic all over Asia, in West and Central Africa and parts of Latin America.
If the patient lives in an endemic area, or has a positive travel history, one should find out if he or she has ever eaten raw or undercooked freshwater crabs, which may harbour the infective stage (metacercariae) of Paragonimus species. Also, consumption of raw wild boar meat is a risk, because wild boar act as paratenic hosts, harbouring juvenile worms. Traditional medicine used in some East Asian countries may contain raw crab meat and juice and potentially act as a source of infection. However, some patients have a negative exposure history, and it has been suggested that even contaminated fingers and cooking utensils may act as a source of infection.
