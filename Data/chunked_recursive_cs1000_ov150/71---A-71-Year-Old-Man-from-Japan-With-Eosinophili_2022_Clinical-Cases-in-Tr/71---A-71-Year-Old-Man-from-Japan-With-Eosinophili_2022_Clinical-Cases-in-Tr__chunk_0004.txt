The most important differential diagnosis for a nodular lesion with or without cavitation in the lung is either pulmonary tuberculosis or lung cancer. The PET-CT is unable to distinguish between a malignancy and an inflammatory lesion of other aetiology, e.g. an infectious process.
Systemic endemic mycoses (e.g. histoplasmosis, blastomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis) may present with a wide variety of pulmonary lesions in otherwise asymptomatic patients; however, they are not endemic in East Asia and the patient does not have a history of travelling abroad.
In addition to abnormal findings on the chest radiograph, this patient shows eosinophilia and elevated total IgE levels. One therefore needs to consider the possibility of pulmonary helminth infections, especially of lung fluke infection (paragonimiasis).
