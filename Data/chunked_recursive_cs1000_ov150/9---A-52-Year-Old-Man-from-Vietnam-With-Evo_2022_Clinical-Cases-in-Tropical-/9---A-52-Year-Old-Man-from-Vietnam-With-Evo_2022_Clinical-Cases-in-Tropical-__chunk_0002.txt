Laboratory results on admission showed the patient's Haemoglobin was 14.6 g/dL and Total bilirubin was 18 μmol/L, both within their reference ranges. Haematocrit was high at 53.9%, compared to the reference range of 40–52%. Platelets were low at 58 x 10⁹/L, well below the reference range of 160–370 x 10⁹/L. The White Cell Count (WCC) was low at 2.1 x 10⁹/L, with Neutrophils at 0.9 x 10⁹/L and Lymphocytes at 0.8 x 10⁹/L also below their respective reference ranges. C-reactive protein was elevated at 20 mg/L, while the reference is less than 4 mg/L. Urea was 7.8 mmol/L and Creatinine was 114 μmol/L, both at the upper limit of their reference ranges. Alanine aminotransferase was highly elevated at 812 U/L, compared to a reference of 7-40 U/L, and Alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 260 U/L, against a reference of 30–130 U/L. Lactate was also high at 3.5 mmol/L, with a reference range of 0.6–1.4 mmol/L.
