Dengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed, (at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however, cross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, especially in Zika endemic areas.
