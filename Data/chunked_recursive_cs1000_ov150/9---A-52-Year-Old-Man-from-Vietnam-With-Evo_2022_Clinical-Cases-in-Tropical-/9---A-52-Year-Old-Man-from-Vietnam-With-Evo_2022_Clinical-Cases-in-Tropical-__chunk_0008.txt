Dengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect humans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosquitoes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock
