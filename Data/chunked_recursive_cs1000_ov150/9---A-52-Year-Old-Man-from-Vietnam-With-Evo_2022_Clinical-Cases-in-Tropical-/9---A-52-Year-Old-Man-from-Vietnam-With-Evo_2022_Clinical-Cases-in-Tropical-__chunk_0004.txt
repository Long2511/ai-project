Having presented in a high-endemicity area, the clinical pic ture is typical of dengue infection with apparent progression to severe disease with vascular leak and compensated shock. Even without an eschar, rickettsial infections, such as scrub typhus, are the most important differential diagnoses. Malaria should also be considered, but there is no evidence of haemolysis to support this, and risk of malaria is very low in most urban areas of Vietnam. Many aspects of the presen tation could be compatible with leptospirosis, but the absence of suspected rodent exposure makes this less likely.

Another differential diagnosis to consider in a diabetic from South East Asia with possible sepsis is melioidosis.
