The patient is diagnosed with compensated shock and is admitted to a high-dependency unit for close observation and supportive care. Ultrasound scans confirm the presence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, as well as mild hepatomegaly and a thickened gallbladder wall. He is infused with Ringer's lactate solution at a volume of 10mL/kg over 1 hour before his fluid status is reassessed. He remains tachycardic and oliguric with a haematocrit rise to 55.1%, therefore the rate of fluid therapy is increased to 15mL/kg/hr until sufficient haemodynamic improvement is shown. The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to 7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every 2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments are undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with haematocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged from hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery
