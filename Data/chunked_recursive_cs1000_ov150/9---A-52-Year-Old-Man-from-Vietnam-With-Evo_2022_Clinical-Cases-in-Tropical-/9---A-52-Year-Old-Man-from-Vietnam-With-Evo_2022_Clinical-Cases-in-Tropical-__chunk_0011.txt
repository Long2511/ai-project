Warning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia, six of which were present in this case.

Uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes, as in this case, have been shown to be risk factors for poor outcomes
