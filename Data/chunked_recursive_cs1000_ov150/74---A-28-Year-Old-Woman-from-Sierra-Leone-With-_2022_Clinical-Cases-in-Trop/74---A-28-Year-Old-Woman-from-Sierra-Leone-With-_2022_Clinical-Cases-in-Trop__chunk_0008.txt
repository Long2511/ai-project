The incubation period is 3 to 21 days. In individuals who are not pregnant the disease normally starts insidiously with fever, body aches and weakness. Sore throat and retrosternal chest pain are common, as are vague abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. Cough and breathlessness may occur in some patients. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Frank bleeding is rare. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate.

Serological and PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and antigen-based rapid point-of-care tests have been licensed, although more testing on the sensitivity for different strains is needed.
