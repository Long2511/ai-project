The treatment for Lassa fever is with IV ribavirin, which is expensive and not commonly available. It seems to improve survival, particularly when given during the first 6 days of symptomatic disease, but the quality of studies on this are poor.

The diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed with antigen testing and the patient received IV ribavirin in a specialist isolation unit. Unfortunately, the patient was already very unwell by this stage and died 2 days later. All of the patient's family, close friends and medical staff were interviewed to determine whether they had had contact with the patient. All contacts were advised to monitor their temperature and seek medical help if they became unwell within 21 days of the contact.
