A 28-year-old woman presents to a small rural hospital in eastern Sierra Leone with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat and retrosternal chest pain. She has had loose stools twice a day for the past 2 days. She was seen in a local health post the day before admission and given a course of artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin, but she had continued to get worse on this. Her examination was unremarkable except some mild pharyngitis. On arrival in hospital she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and she completed the course of her antimalarial medications. Her malaria slide was negative. She remained on this treatment for 2 days but continued to get worse.

On the second day after admission she develops conjunctivitis. By this stage she is very unwell and is unable to walk unaided. She has developed a cough and breathlessness.

Axillary temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure 80/55 mmHg, pulse rate 100 bpm. On chest auscultation she has bilateral fine crepitations.
