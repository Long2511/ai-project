Typhoid can present as a non-specific febrile illness. You would expect the patient to eventually improve on ceftriaxone, but prolonged clinical courses in typhoid are not uncommon. Pharyngitis and conjunctivitis are usually not part of the clinical picture.

Lassa fever is quite common in Eastern Sierra Leone, accounting for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some studies. All the signs and symptoms the patient has are consistent with Lassa fever.
