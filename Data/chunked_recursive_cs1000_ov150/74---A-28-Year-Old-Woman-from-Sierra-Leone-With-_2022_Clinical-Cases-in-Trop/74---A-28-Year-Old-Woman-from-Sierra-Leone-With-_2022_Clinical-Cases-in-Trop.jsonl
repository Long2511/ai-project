She has had loose stools twice a day for the past 2 days. She was seen in a local health post the day before admission and given a course of artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin, but she had continued to get worse on this. Her examination was unremarkable except some mild pharyngitis. On arrival in hospital she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and she completed the course of her antimalarial medications. Her malaria slide was negative. She remained on this treatment for 2 days but continued to get worse.\n\nOn the second day after admission she develops conjunctivitis. By this stage she is very unwell and is unable to walk unaided. She has developed a cough and breathlessness.\n\nAxillary temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure 80/55 mmHg, pulse rate 100 bpm. On chest auscultation she has bilateral fine crepitations."}

On chest auscultation she has bilateral fine crepitations.\n\nHer chest radiograph reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood chemistry shows mild renal impairment and raised transaminases. The aspartate transaminase (AST/GOT) was 514 U/L, with a normal value being less than 50 U/L.\n\nA young Sierra Leonean woman has a severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis and chest involvement. She deteriorates on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials.\n\nAdenovirus infections can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis but these are normally mild. Also, measles presents with fever, cough, coryza and a striking conjunctivitis. It may also cause pneumonitis, but at this stage you would expect to see a rash.\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae can cause a pharyngitis and pneumonia but is rarely severe. Other forms of pneumonia are possible but do not normally cause conjunctivitis."}

Pulmonary involvement including haemorrhages is common and it can cause renal impairment. Patients with severe leptospirosis tend to present with conjunctival suffusions rather than with conjunctivitis.\n\nTyphoid can present as a non-specific febrile illness. You would expect the patient to eventually improve on ceftriaxone, but prolonged clinical courses in typhoid are not uncommon. Pharyngitis and conjunctivitis are usually not part of the clinical picture.\n\nLassa fever is quite common in Eastern Sierra Leone, accounting for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some studies. All the signs and symptoms the patient has are consistent with Lassa fever."}

It has caused nosocomial outbreaks in which many medical staff have died. Therefore all procedures should be done with caution and the possibility of Lassa fever should always be discussed with the laboratory. All specimens should be transported in sealed plastic containers.\n\nSerological and PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and an antigen-based rapid point-of-care test has been licensed.\n\nPCR tests are the most sensitive but are not available in most African countries. Antigen tests demonstrate the presence of the disease but may not detect low levels of the virus, especially if taken in the first days of illness. IgM antibody tests can show a high rate of false positive tests and may be hard to interpret."}

Because the infection spreads through contact with blood or body fluids, the use of goggles, masks, double gloves and disposable (waterproof) surgical gowns is recommended when handling the patient until the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever has been ruled out.\n\nThe patient should be isolated in a side room, which should ideally have an area outside for decontamination (i.e. removing potentially contaminated clothing). Needles and sharps should be handled with care by experienced staff. After significant occupational exposure to the bodily fluid of a patient with Lassa fever such as a needlestick injury, post-exposure prophylaxis with oral ribavirin should be considered."}

It seems to improve survival, particularly when given during the first 6 days of symptomatic disease, but the quality of studies on this are poor.\n\nThe diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed with antigen testing and the patient received IV ribavirin in a specialist isolation unit. Unfortunately, the patient was already very unwell by this stage and died 2 days later. All of the patient's family, close friends and medical staff were interviewed to determine whether they had had contact with the patient. All contacts were advised to monitor their temperature and seek medical help if they became unwell within 21 days of the contact."}

It is a zoonosis of rats of the genus Mastomys and infections in humans are likely to result from contact with infected rat urine. Lassa fever is common in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria, although it probably occurs in a much larger area of sub-Saharan West Africa. Cases have been imported to Europe from other countries such as Mali, Côte d'Ivoire and Togo. There are up to 300000 cases estimated a year with 5000 deaths, although the confidence limits of this estimate are likely to be very broad.\n\nMost cases are thought to be mild and patients may not even present to a health facility; but in hospitalized patients, the case fatality rate may be as high as 20%. Lassa fever is more severe in pregnant women, with a higher case fatality rate in the third trimester. It frequently results in premature labour or spontaneous abortion and about 90% of fetuses of women infected with Lassa fever die."}

In individuals who are not pregnant the disease normally starts insidiously with fever, body aches and weakness. Sore throat and retrosternal chest pain are common, as are vague abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. Cough and breathlessness may occur in some patients. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Frank bleeding is rare. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate.\n\nSerological and PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and antigen-based rapid point-of-care tests have been licensed, although more testing on the sensitivity for different strains is needed."}
{"id": "74---A-28-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sierra-Leone-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop__0009", "text": "Because Lassa fever is common, it should be considered in anyone with an unexplained febrile condition who has visited an endemic area within the past 21 days and appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented. It is more common in people from rural than urban areas, but it does occur in towns. Treatment with IV ribavirin is likely to be beneficial if given early in the disease, but it should also be considered in patients who are diagnosed late."}
