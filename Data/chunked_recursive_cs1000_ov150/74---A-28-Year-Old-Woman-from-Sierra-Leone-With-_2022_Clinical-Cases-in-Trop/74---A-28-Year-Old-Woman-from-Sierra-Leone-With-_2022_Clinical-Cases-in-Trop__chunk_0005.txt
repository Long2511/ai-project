The patient needs to be isolated until the results of the Lassa fever tests are known. Because the infection spreads through contact with blood or body fluids, the use of goggles, masks, double gloves and disposable (waterproof) surgical gowns is recommended when handling the patient until the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever has been ruled out.

The patient should be isolated in a side room, which should ideally have an area outside for decontamination (i.e. removing potentially contaminated clothing). Needles and sharps should be handled with care by experienced staff. After significant occupational exposure to the bodily fluid of a patient with Lassa fever such as a needlestick injury, post-exposure prophylaxis with oral ribavirin should be considered.
