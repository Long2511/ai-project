Because Lassa fever is common, it should be considered in anyone with an unexplained febrile condition who has visited an endemic area within the past 21 days and appropriate infection control precautions should be implemented. It is more common in people from rural than urban areas, but it does occur in towns. Treatment with IV ribavirin is likely to be beneficial if given early in the disease, but it should also be considered in patients who are diagnosed late.
