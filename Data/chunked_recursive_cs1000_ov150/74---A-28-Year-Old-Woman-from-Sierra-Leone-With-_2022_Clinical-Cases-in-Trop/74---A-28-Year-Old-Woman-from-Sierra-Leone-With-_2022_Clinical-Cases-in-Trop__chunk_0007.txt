Lassa fever is a severe systemic disease caused by infection with an arenavirus. It is a zoonosis of rats of the genus Mastomys and infections in humans are likely to result from contact with infected rat urine. Lassa fever is common in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria, although it probably occurs in a much larger area of sub-Saharan West Africa. Cases have been imported to Europe from other countries such as Mali, Côte d'Ivoire and Togo. There are up to 300000 cases estimated a year with 5000 deaths, although the confidence limits of this estimate are likely to be very broad.

Most cases are thought to be mild and patients may not even present to a health facility; but in hospitalized patients, the case fatality rate may be as high as 20%. Lassa fever is more severe in pregnant women, with a higher case fatality rate in the third trimester. It frequently results in premature labour or spontaneous abortion and about 90% of fetuses of women infected with Lassa fever die.
