The pathogenesis of the subarachnoid form is largely mediated by the host's inflammatory response. Clinically, it can manifest as meningitis, communicating hydrocepha- lus, focal neurological symptoms and cerebrovascular disease. Increased intracranial pressure because of hydrocephalus is the most common presentation. Vascular involvement is a common, but frequently unrecognized manifestation of SANCC. The inflammation of the vessel can result in occlu- sive endarteritis, aneurysm formation and thrombosis. Small perforating vessels are most affected, resulting in lacunar infarcts proximal to cysts as seen in this patient. In many instances, the CT angiography will be negative.
