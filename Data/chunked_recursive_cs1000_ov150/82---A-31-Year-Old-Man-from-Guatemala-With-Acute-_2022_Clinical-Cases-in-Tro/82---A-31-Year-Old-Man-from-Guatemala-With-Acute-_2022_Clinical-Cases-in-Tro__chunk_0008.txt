Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium in the central nervous system. It is endemic in Latin America, Asia and Africa, where its transmission is favoured by poor sanitary conditions. The mechanism of transmission is faecal-oral and person to person, but requires the presence of free-roaming pigs to perpetuate the life cycle.
Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis is the most severe form because of the large dimension of the cysts, exuberant inflam- matory response leading to complications and slow response to therapy. Neuroimaging and serology are complementary for diagnosis. MRI is superior for the detection of subarachnoid cysts than CT, and the serological gold standard is the immunoblot. Compared with the parenchymal form, SANCC needs a longer duration and usually double the antiparasitic treatment along with corticosteroids. Neuroimaging and serum antigen should be repeated periodically to assess for clinical response and decision to stop treatment.
