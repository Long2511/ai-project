These findings and the epidemiological risk factors are highly suggestive of subarachnoid neurocysticercosis.
The clinical expression of neurocysticercosis is pleomor- phic and depends on the location, burden of disease and host inflammatory response. Disease in the parenchyma behaves differently from neurocysticercosis involving the extra- parenchymal space. Therefore clinical presentation and therapeutic interventions for each location are different. Sub- arachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) is probably the most severe form of neurocysticercosis. In the subarachnoid space, the parasite can undergo an aberrant continued growth and reach large sizes, especially when it is located in the Sylvian fissure. SANCC also has a high frequency of concomitant asymptomatic spinal involvement. Therefore an MRI of the spine should always be included.
