Principles of treatment for parenchymal neurocysticerco- sis cannot be extrapolated to those patients with SANCC. Antiparasitics are always indicated in the treatment of SANCC and many experts recommend dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel.
The duration of treatment is still controversial, but cur- rent guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.
Corticosteroids are also critical to reduce the inflamma- tion secondary to antiparasitic treatment. A careful taper of steroids should be employed to avoid complications, such as hydrocephalus, meningitis, and vasculitis. Patients may need a long course of treatment with neuroimaging every 3 months to assess the clinical response.
