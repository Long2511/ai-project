A serum immunoblot for cysticercosis run at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was positive. The serum cysticercosis antigen was positive at the beginning of therapy. A spine MRI did not show evidence of spinal involvement. The patient was begun on a high dose of pred- nisone followed by a taper, and dual therapy with albenda- zole and praziquantel. After 9 months of treatment, his serum antigen was negative and his lesions resolved on imag- ing. He has been followed closely with no recurrence.
