A 31-year-old Guatemalan man with no past medical history presents to a hospital in New York City with several minutes of weakness and numbness of the leg. His symptoms resolved just before his arrival at the hospital. Two weeks previously, he also had two episodes of facial twitching that subsided without intervention after 10 seconds.
He was born and lived in a rural area of Guatemala before immigrating to New York 5 years ago. In Guatemala, his family owned uncorralled pigs and his house did not have sanitation services.

His vitals were normal. Cranial nerves were intact. Motor and sensory examinations were normal. Deep tendon reflexes and gait was normal. The rest of the exam was unremarkable.

Cell blood count and serum chemistry were within normal limits.

The computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission are shown in Figures 82.1 and 82.2. A CT angiography showed patent cerebral arteries.
