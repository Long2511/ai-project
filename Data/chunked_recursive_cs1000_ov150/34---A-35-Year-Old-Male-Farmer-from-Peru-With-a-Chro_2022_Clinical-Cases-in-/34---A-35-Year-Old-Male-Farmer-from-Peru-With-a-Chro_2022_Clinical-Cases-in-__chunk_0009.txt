The fungi are scarce in tissues and generally not detected on microscopy. Serology is not useful because of low sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis is based on isolation of the organism by culture of the skin biopsy, lesion aspirate, or sputum. S. schenckii grows on Saboraud agar at 25 to 27°C. Also, molecular methods may be used.
