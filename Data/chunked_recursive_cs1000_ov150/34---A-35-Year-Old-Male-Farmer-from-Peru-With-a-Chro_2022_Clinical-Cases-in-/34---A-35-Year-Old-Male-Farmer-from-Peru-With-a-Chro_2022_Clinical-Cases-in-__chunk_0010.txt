Spontaneous resolution of the lesions is rare. Itraconazole PO 200 mg/day is considered the drug of choice for cutaneous sporotrichosis. The treatment should be continued for 2 to 4 weeks after resolution of all lesions, typically 3 to 6 months but sometimes even requiring years. Saturated solution of potassium iodide, a cheap and effective drug, has also been widely used but its low tolerability and many unpleasant side effects (e.g., salivary gland swelling, metallic taste, rash and fever) limit its use. Terbinafine is also an alternative treatment. Itraconazole (200mg PO bd for 1-2 years) is also the preferred drug for pulmonary or osteoarticular sporotrichosis. In severely ill patients or patients with disseminated disease, initial therapy with amphotericin B is recommended, with conversion to oral itraconazole after a favourable response and stabilization
