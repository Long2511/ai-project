In Peru, the common differential diagnoses of a chronic ulcer with nodular lymphangitis include cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis and mycobacterial infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum.

Leishmaniasis is endemic in the Andes between 1000 and 3000 m altitude and in the Amazon Basin. The patient's origin and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, the lack of clinical improvement after a complete course of pentavalent antimonials (>80% cure rate) makes this diagnosis unlikely.
