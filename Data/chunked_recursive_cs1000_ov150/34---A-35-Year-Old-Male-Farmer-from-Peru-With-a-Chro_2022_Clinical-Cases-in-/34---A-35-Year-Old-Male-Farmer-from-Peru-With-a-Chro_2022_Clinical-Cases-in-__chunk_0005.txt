The first step is the collection of specimens for microscopy (smears for Gram, Giemsa and Ziehl-Neelsen stains), culture and, if available, PCR for Leishmania and Mycobacterium species and Sporothrix schenckii. Specimens should be collected by scraping of the base of the active ulcer, biopsy of the edge of the lesion, and fine-needle aspiration of one of the lymphatic nodules. If available, a leishmanin skin test would be a useful diagnostic tool. Fungi such as S. schenckii grow on special media and the laboratory should be informed of the clinical suspicion of sporotrichosis. The initial evaluation should also include chest radiography and a PPD skin test to rule out tuberculosis.
