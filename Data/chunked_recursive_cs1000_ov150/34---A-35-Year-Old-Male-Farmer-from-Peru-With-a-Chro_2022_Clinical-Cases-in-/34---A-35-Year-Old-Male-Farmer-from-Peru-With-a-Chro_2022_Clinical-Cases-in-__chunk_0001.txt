A 35-year-old farmer from the Peruvian highlands presents to a reference hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-month history of a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on his left arm.

Two months before presentation, the patient suffered a scratch on his left hand from a tree branch while working in the fields. After a few days, he noticed a small painless erythematous papule that later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks new pustules appeared, and the lesion started to ulcerate and increased in size, despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule the patient noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. The patient was seen at a regional hospital and treated empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials, but showed no improvement. He was then referred for further diagnosis and treatment.
