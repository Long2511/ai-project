Sporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by S. schenckii, a dimorphic fungus with a worldwide distribution, existing as a saprophytic mould in soil and plants and as a yeast in tissues. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is the most common form of the disease, which is acquired by inoculation during minor injury by animal bites, plant thorns or other cutting vegetation. Sporotrichosis has in addition emerged as a zoonosis transmitted mainly by infected cats, with epidemic outbreaks in Brazil and some countries in South America, caused by S. brasiliensis. The upper limbs are most commonly affected. The infection is usually limited to the cutaneous, subcutaneous and lymphatic tissues surrounding the injury. The initial papule at the inoculation site typically grows slowly into a nodule and then ulcerates. Contiguous lymphatic spread is very common (48-92%) and is referred to as 'nodular lymphangitis' or 'sporotrichoid lymphangitis'. The majority of cases are sporadic
