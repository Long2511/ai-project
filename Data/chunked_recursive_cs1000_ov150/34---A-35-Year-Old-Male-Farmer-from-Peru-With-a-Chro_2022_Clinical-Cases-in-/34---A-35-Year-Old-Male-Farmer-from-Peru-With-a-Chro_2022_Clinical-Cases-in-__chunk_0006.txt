The chest x-ray was normal and PPD skin testing was negative. No leishmania parasites were observed by direct microscopy, and the leishmanin skin test was negative. Leishmania culture was not performed. Mycobacterial cultures were negative. However, culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.

A diagnosis of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis was made. The mild anaemia was likely to be unrelated. The patient was started on itraconazole PO 200 mg/day. After 8 months of treatment the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved and the patient was considered to be cured.
