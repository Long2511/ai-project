Sporotrichosis is the second most important diagnosis to consider. The patient's clinical features are typical and the disease is commonly seen in Peru. Another diagnosis to keep in mind is secondary cutaneous tuberculosis, especially because the patient has likely been exposed to M. tuberculosis during his lifetime. The patient has no history of exposure to fresh and saltwater environments to suggest infection with M. marinum. Nocardiosis (Nocardia brasiliensis) and tularaemia (Francisella tularensis) are other causes of nodular lymphangitis but are unlikely in this patient, because nocardiosis is rare and tularaemia has never been reported in the southern hemisphere.
