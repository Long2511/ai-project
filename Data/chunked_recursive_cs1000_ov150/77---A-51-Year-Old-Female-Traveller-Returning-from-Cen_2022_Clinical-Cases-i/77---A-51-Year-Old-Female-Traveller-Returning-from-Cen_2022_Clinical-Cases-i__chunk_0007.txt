The diagnosis is made by the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen or specific IgM, or by the documentation of a ≥ four-fold rise of specific IgG antibody titres in paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples. In resource-poor countries, as well as in daily clinical practice in travel medicine, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue (testing for NS1-Ag, IgM, and IgG) and chikungunya (testing for IgM) are widely available and often the primarily performed diagnostic tests. RDTs to diagnose Zika virus infections are under development.

In our case, RDTs for dengue and chikungunya were negative.

Because the performed RDTs for dengue and chikungunya both showed a negative result, the patient's blood samples were sent to a reference laboratory for arboviruses and our clinical suspicion of a Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR as well as seroconversion (Table 77.2). A rise in anti-Dengue IgG was interpreted as cross-reactivity which is common among viruses of the same family.
