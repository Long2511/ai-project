A comparison of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika infections shows several clinical differences. The incubation period is 4 to 10 days for Dengue, 3 to 7 days for Chikungunya, and 3 to 12 days for Zika. The rate of asymptomatic infection is between 50 and 80 percent for Dengue, between 3 and 28 percent for Chikungunya, and approximately 80 percent for Zika. Fever and headache are very common in Dengue. Fever is also very common in Chikungunya, while headache is common. In Zika infections, fever and headache are less common. Conjunctivitis is common in Zika but not typical for Dengue or Chikungunya. Arthralgias are very common in Chikungunya, common in Dengue, and less common in Zika. Myalgias are common in Dengue but less common in both Chikungunya and Zika. A skin rash is very common in Zika, and common in both Dengue and Chikungunya. Peripheral oedema is common in Zika but not a feature of the other two infections
