A 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presented to the outpatient department 6 days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador. Four days after her return, the patient noticed a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash on the face, trunk, and extremities. There was no fever and no other accompanying symptoms. On the next day the rash worsened and a non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis developed. The patient did not report any chronic underlying disease nor the intake of any medication.

The patient was afebrile. Upon inspection there was conjunctivitis and a generalised maculopapular rash, also involving the face. Additionally, the patient showed tender oedema of the hands, elbows, knees and feet (Fig. 77.1). There was also generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary, and inguinal).

The full blood count was normal. CRP was 8 mg/L (<5) and creatinine was very mildly elevated (87 µmol/L, range 35-80 µmol/L). Liver function tests were normal.
