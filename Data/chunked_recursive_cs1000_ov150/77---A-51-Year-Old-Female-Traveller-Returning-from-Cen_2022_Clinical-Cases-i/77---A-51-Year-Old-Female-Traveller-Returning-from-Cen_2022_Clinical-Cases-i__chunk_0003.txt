The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection, which is also in line with the putative incubation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chikungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduction, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years.
