Flaccid paraparesis can present with or without bladder involvement and a sensory level. When presenting with these symptoms, the neuroanatomical diagnosis could be an acute spinal cord lesion or an acute cauda equina lesion. Common aetiologies for an acute spinal cord lesion in tropical countries include inflammation of the spinal cord, known as myelitis, or ischaemia of the spinal cord, known as spinal infarction. Common causes for an acute cauda equina lesion are metastatic malignancy or schistosomiasis. When flaccid paraparesis presents without bladder dysfunction or a sensory level, the diagnosis is either polyradiculoneuropathy or polyneuropathy. Common examples of polyradiculoneuropathy include Guillain-Barré-syndrome, tuberculous arachnoiditis, and CMV in HIV. Examples of polyneuropathy include causes related to diabetes, HIV, or nutrition
