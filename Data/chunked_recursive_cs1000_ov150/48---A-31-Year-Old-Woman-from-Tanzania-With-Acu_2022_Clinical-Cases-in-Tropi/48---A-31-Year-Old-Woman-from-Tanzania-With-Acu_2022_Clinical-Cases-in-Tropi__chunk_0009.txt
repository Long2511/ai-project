The x-rays of her chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.
The main differential diagnosis of acute non-compressive flaccid paraparesis that localizes in the spinal cord is acute spinal cord inflammation (acute transverse myelitis), and vascular spinal cord ischaemia (“spinal stroke”). The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein level are suggestive of inflammation in the spinal cord. Hence, the clinicolaboratory diagnosis is that of acute transverse myelitis.
