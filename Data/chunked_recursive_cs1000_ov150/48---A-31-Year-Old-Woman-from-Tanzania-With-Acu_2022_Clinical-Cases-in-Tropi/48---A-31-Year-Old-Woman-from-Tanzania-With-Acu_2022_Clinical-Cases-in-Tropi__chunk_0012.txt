Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is an inflammation of the spinal cord characterized by an acute (hours) or sub-acute (days) onset, presenting typically with back pain, flaccid paraplegia, a sensory level on the trunk and urinary incontinence. The incidence of ATM in tropical countries is reported to be <1/100 000 but is likely to be much higher particularly in Africa. Women are more frequently affected, typically in their second and fourth decades. Evidence of inflammation within the spinal cord is shown by increased lymphocytes and elevated protein in the CSF. It can be associated with infections and autoimmune disorders. Symptoms that suggest infection include fever, rash, adenopathy, concurrent systemic infection and symptoms of herpes zoster radiculopathy. If the aetiology remains unknown as is frequently the case, the ATM is termed idiopathic. Idiopathic ATM is considered to be an autoimmune phenomenon
