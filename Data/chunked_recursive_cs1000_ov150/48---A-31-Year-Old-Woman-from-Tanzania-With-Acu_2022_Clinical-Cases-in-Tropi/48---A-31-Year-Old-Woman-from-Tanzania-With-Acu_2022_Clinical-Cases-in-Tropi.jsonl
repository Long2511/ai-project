She describes being perfectly well up until 2 days earlier when she felt acute back pain which radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. The pain was severe, continuous, burning and unrelieved by analgesics or position. Within 12 hours the pain had lessened but she developed numbness in her feet and legs ascending to the level of her waist, loss of power in her legs and loss of control of her bladder. There is a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks previously, treated as malaria. There is no past or family history of similar illness and no history of trauma. She is married with 3 children, the last born is 12 months old. She does not smoke or take alcohol, and her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative."}

General examination is unremarkable; there is no spinal tenderness, deformity or gibbus. On neurological examination she is fully orientated and higher mental functions appear normal. Cranial nerves including fundoscopy and upper limbs are normal. She is unable to move her legs and examination of the lower limbs reveals a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. On inspection feet are in a slightly plantar-flexed position. Tone is reduced bilaterally, power is reduced (MRC grade 1/5) in all muscle groups. Reflexes are absent bilaterally, and plantar reflexes are extensor. Sensation is reduced to light touch to the level of the umbilicus. Joint position sense is impaired in the feet and ankles, and vibration sense is absent to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally."}

She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior, but has otherwise been well.\n\nThe clinical syndromic diagnosis is acute flaccid paraparesis. The main neuroanatomical differential diagnoses of flaccid paraparesis are lesions of peripheral nerves, including their roots (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies), and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the umbilicus (T10 level) and extensor plantar reflexes localise the site of the lesion to the spinal cord. The flaccidity and loss of reflexes can be explained by the early flaccid phase of acute spinal cord injury when spasticity appears days or weeks later."}

The latter has to be interpreted with caution because it stays positive after past infection. Urine and stool analysis for ova of Schistosoma species should be done.\nLumbar puncture should be performed with measurement of opening pressure and testing cell differentiation, CSF protein, glucose, Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF for M. tuberculosis and VDRL. Imaging should include x-rays of the chest and spine. Neuroimaging (e.g. spinal CT/MRI) is recommended mainly to exclude a compressive spinal cord lesion but is usually not readily available in sub-Saharan Africa."}

When presenting with these symptoms, the neuroanatomical diagnosis could be an acute spinal cord lesion or an acute cauda equina lesion. Common aetiologies for an acute spinal cord lesion in tropical countries include inflammation of the spinal cord, known as myelitis, or ischaemia of the spinal cord, known as spinal infarction. Common causes for an acute cauda equina lesion are metastatic malignancy or schistosomiasis. When flaccid paraparesis presents without bladder dysfunction or a sensory level, the diagnosis is either polyradiculoneuropathy or polyneuropathy. Common examples of polyradiculoneuropathy include Guillain-Barré-syndrome, tuberculous arachnoiditis, and CMV in HIV. Examples of polyneuropathy include causes related to diabetes, HIV, or nutrition"}

Treatment in this patient includes steroids and acyclovir directed against the main causes of acute transverse myelitis, e.g. autoimmune inflammation and viral infections (see Summary Box). Counselling of patient and family is very important, and family members/guardians should from the beginning on be actively involved in physiotherapy and mobilization of the patient. General measures include strict 2 hourly turning, frequent passive movements, urinary catheterization if non-functioning bladder, and adequate analgesia according to the WHO analgesic ladder.\nThe patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She partially improved and was discharged after 3 weeks. The power in her legs had slightly improved (MRC 2-3/5) and she had a urinary catheter in situ.

In the majority of cases, which are idiopathic, it is presumably an autoimmune phenomenon and may be a manifestation of a chronic autoimmune demyelinating CNS disease like NMO or multiple sclerosis; treatment involves corticosteroids against inflammation. When associated with infection, the cause may be direct invasion of the spinal cord by microorganisms, in which case causative treatment like acyclovir for VZV myelitis is used. Alternatively, it can be a parainfectious autoimmune phenomenon resulting from an infection elsewhere or associated with vaccination, for which corticosteroids are used against inflammation. When associated with a known systemic autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or secondary vasculitis, the pathophysiology is also an autoimmune phenomenon, and the treatment is corticosteroids against inflammation."}

The incidence of ATM in tropical countries is reported to be <1/100 000 but is likely to be much higher particularly in Africa. Women are more frequently affected, typically in their second and fourth decades. Evidence of inflammation within the spinal cord is shown by increased lymphocytes and elevated protein in the CSF. It can be associated with infections and autoimmune disorders. Symptoms that suggest infection include fever, rash, adenopathy, concurrent systemic infection and symptoms of herpes zoster radiculopathy. If the aetiology remains unknown as is frequently the case, the ATM is termed idiopathic. Idiopathic ATM is considered to be an autoimmune phenomenon"}
