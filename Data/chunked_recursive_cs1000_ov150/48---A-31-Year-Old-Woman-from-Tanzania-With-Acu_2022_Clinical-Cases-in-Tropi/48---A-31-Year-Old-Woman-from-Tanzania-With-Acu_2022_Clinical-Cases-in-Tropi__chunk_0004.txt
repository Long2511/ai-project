If available, the following investigations should be performed:
Full blood count, ESR, blood glucose, renal and liver function tests, HIV serology, VDRL test and schistosomiasis serology. The latter has to be interpreted with caution because it stays positive after past infection. Urine and stool analysis for ova of Schistosoma species should be done.
Lumbar puncture should be performed with measurement of opening pressure and testing cell differentiation, CSF protein, glucose, Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF for M. tuberculosis and VDRL. Imaging should include x-rays of the chest and spine. Neuroimaging (e.g. spinal CT/MRI) is recommended mainly to exclude a compressive spinal cord lesion but is usually not readily available in sub-Saharan Africa.
