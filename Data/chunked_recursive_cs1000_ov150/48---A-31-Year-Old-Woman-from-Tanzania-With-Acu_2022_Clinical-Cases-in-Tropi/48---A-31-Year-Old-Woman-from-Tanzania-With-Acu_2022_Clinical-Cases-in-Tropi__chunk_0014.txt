Treatment of idiopathic ATM in adults is largely empirical with high doses of IV corticosteroids followed by oral prednisolone for 2 to 3 weeks. Empirical acyclovir is also recommended if VZV or HSV myelitis cannot be excluded. The majority (70% to 80%) of patients with ATM remain disabled with flaccid paraparesis/paraplegia and incontinence.
