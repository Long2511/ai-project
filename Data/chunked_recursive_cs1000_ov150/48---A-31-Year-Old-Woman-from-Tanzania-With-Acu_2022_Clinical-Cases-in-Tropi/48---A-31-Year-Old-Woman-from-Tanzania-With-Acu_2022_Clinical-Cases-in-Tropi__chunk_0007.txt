The patient's full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal. Results of further blood tests are shown in the Table 48.2.
A spinal tap was done. The CSF opening pressure was normal and looked clear. Further CSF results are shown in the Table 48.3.

The patient's laboratory results on admission showed an ESR of 19 mm/h, which is above the normal range of less than 10 mm/h. Her random blood glucose was 5.6 mmol/l, within the normal range of 3.9 to 11.1 mmol/l. Her HIV-Serology and p24 Antigen test, VDRL test, and schistosomiasis-serology were all negative, which is normal. The test for ova of S. haematobium in her urine and the test for ova of S. mansoni in her stool were also negative, as expected.
