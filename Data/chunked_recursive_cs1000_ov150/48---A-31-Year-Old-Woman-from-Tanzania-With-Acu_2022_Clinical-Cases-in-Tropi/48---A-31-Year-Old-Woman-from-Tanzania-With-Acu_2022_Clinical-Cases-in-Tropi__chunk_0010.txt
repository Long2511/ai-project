The management is based on principles of establishing and treating the cause and preventing complications. Treatment in this patient includes steroids and acyclovir directed against the main causes of acute transverse myelitis, e.g. autoimmune inflammation and viral infections (see Summary Box). Counselling of patient and family is very important, and family members/guardians should from the beginning on be actively involved in physiotherapy and mobilization of the patient. General measures include strict 2 hourly turning, frequent passive movements, urinary catheterization if non-functioning bladder, and adequate analgesia according to the WHO analgesic ladder.
The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She partially improved and was discharged after 3 weeks. The power in her legs had slightly improved (MRC 2-3/5) and she had a urinary catheter in situ. She will be reviewed in the outpatient department.
