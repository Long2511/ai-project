The pathophysiology of acute transverse myelitis varies. In the majority of cases, which are idiopathic, it is presumably an autoimmune phenomenon and may be a manifestation of a chronic autoimmune demyelinating CNS disease like NMO or multiple sclerosis; treatment involves corticosteroids against inflammation. When associated with infection, the cause may be direct invasion of the spinal cord by microorganisms, in which case causative treatment like acyclovir for VZV myelitis is used. Alternatively, it can be a parainfectious autoimmune phenomenon resulting from an infection elsewhere or associated with vaccination, for which corticosteroids are used against inflammation. When associated with a known systemic autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or secondary vasculitis, the pathophysiology is also an autoimmune phenomenon, and the treatment is corticosteroids against inflammation.
