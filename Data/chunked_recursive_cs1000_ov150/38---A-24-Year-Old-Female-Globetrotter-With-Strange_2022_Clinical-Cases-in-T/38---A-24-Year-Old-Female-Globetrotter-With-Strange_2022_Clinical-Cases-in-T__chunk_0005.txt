The EITB came back positive for serum and CSF and a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was made.

The patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg bd pig faeces which contain for 10 days and started on antiepileptic drugs. She declined treatment with steroids. She did not attend her 3-month follow-up but returned as an outpatient 1 year later. She had remained seizure-free for 1 year. MRI of the brain showed regression of all cysts. A CT scan on 2-year follow-up showed two calcifications. Her antiepileptic treatment was stopped after a seizure-free period of 3 years.
