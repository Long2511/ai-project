The stages of a cysticercal cyst involve distinct neuroimaging and biological characteristics with corresponding treatment recommendations. In the vesicular stage, neuroimaging shows a lesion that is isointense or isodense to CSF without contrast enhancement; biologically, this represents a viable, non-immunogenic cyst that can persist for years without symptoms. For one to two cysts in this stage, the recommended treatment is albendazole plus steroids for 10 to 14 days. In the colloidal stage, imaging reveals a cyst with an enhanced wall and surrounding oedema. This indicates a viable but degenerating and immunogenic cyst. If more than two cysts are present, the treatment is albendazole plus praziquantel and steroids for 10 to 14 days. However, for both the vesicular and colloidal stages, antihelminthic treatment is contraindicated if diffuse cerebral oedema is present
