This started in the right side of her face, marched to her right arm and then continued to involve her right leg. She describes the feeling as 'pins and needles' lasting for about 2 minutes. She had a similar episode several months ago. At that time, she did not consult a doctor."}

She travelled extensively through South America (Ecuador, Peru, Argentina) and South-east Asia (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia), staying in hostels or private accommodations. She describes herself as an 'eco-traveller', visiting the countryside and staying with local people. She has been a strict vegan for the past 8 years. She would eat food from local vendors but never any animal products. Her main diet during her travelling consisted of fruits, vegetables, nuts and rice.\n\nOn examination she looks well and is afebrile. Her neurological examination is completely unremarkable. The rest of her physical examination is also normal.\n\nHer routine blood investigations, including differential blood count and C-reactive protein are completely normal. Her CSF examination is unremarkable."}

Four years previously she went on an extensive backpacking trip around the world, visiting various places in South America and Asia. She lives on a vegan diet. Her physical examination including her neurological status are completely normal. The basic blood and CSF results are normal and do not reveal any signs of inflammation. The MRI of the brain shows multiple cystic lesions in both hemispheres.\n\nThe patient presents with a focal epileptic seizure. Her paraesthesias represent a so-called Jacksonian 'sensory march'. Neuroimaging reveals multiple cortical and subcortical lesions. The cortical lesions in the left hemisphere are likely to be responsible for the patient's epileptic disorder on the contralateral side of her body."}

Given the presentation (healthy-looking patient, no immunosuppression, no fever, one similar episode a while ago with no progression of symptoms) and her travel history to South America and South-east Asia the most likely diagnosis is neurocysticercosis with multiple cysts in the vesicular and colloidal stage. An enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) for the detection of anticysticercal antibodies in serum and CSF should be done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient should receive antiparasitic treatment, corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe EITB came back positive for serum and CSF and a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was made."}

In the vesicular stage, neuroimaging shows a lesion that is isointense or isodense to CSF without contrast enhancement; biologically, this represents a viable, non-immunogenic cyst that can persist for years without symptoms. For one to two cysts in this stage, the recommended treatment is albendazole plus steroids for 10 to 14 days. In the colloidal stage, imaging reveals a cyst with an enhanced wall and surrounding oedema. This indicates a viable but degenerating and immunogenic cyst. If more than two cysts are present, the treatment is albendazole plus praziquantel and steroids for 10 to 14 days. However, for both the vesicular and colloidal stages, antihelminthic treatment is contraindicated if diffuse cerebral oedema is present"}

It is widely prevalent in Africa, Asia and Latin America and is considered by the WHO to be the most common preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world.\n\nHumans acquire neurocysticercosis by eating food, e.g. salad or vegetables, contaminated with T. solium eggs. This explains why even individuals who do not eat pork meat for religious or ideological reasons can get neurocysticercosis, as seen in this case. (Consuming infested pork meat leads to intestinal infection with adult pork tapeworm).\n\nConsumed ova release oncospheres that penetrate the intestinal wall to spread haematogenously throughout the host's body. In the CNS they become encysted affecting either the CNS parenchyma or, less commonly, the subarachnoid space."}

The most common clinical presentation is focal epileptic seizures. Cysts in the subarachnoid space can cause hydrocephalus, producing headache and altered mental state. Diagnosis is based on neuroimaging, serology and epidemiological evidence.\n\nOnly vesicular and colloidal cysts are amenable to anthelmintic treatment. Albendazole or the combination of albendazole and praziquantel can decrease the number of active lesions and reduce long-term seizure frequency. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy before antiparasitic drugs is recommended for all patients treated with anthelmintic drugs.\n\nIn patients with untreated hydrocephalus or diffuse cerebral oedema, management of elevated intracranial pressure alone without antiparasitic treatment is recommended. The management of patients with diffuse cerebral oedema should be antiinflammatory therapy with corticosteroids; hydrocephalus usually requires a surgical approach."}

Radiological follow-ups at 6-month intervals are recommended.
