A 24-year-old Dutch yoga instructor presents to an emergency room in Berlin, Germany, with one episode of strange sensations in the right side of her body. This started in the right side of her face, marched to her right arm and then continued to involve her right leg. She describes the feeling as 'pins and needles' lasting for about 2 minutes. She had a similar episode several months ago. At that time, she did not consult a doctor.
