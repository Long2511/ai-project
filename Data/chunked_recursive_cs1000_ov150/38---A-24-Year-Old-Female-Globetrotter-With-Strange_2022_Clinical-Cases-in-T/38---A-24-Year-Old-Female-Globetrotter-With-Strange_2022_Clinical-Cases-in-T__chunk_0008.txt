Neurocysticercosis is a CNS infestation with the larval form of Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm). It is widely prevalent in Africa, Asia and Latin America and is considered by the WHO to be the most common preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world.

Humans acquire neurocysticercosis by eating food, e.g. salad or vegetables, contaminated with T. solium eggs. This explains why even individuals who do not eat pork meat for religious or ideological reasons can get neurocysticercosis, as seen in this case. (Consuming infested pork meat leads to intestinal infection with adult pork tapeworm).

Consumed ova release oncospheres that penetrate the intestinal wall to spread haematogenously throughout the host's body. In the CNS they become encysted affecting either the CNS parenchyma or, less commonly, the subarachnoid space.
