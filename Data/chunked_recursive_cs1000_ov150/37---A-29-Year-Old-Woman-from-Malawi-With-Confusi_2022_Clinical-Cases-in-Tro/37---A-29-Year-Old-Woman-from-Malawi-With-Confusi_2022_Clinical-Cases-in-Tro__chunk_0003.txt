The patient presents with a triad of neuropsychiatric changes, watery diarrhoea and a photosensitive dermatitis. This clinical triad - diarrhoea, dermatitis, dementia – is typical of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency). The rainy season, during which the patient presents, is not only the peak of malaria transmission but is also the 'hungry season'. Stocks have been consumed, the new crop is not ready for harvesting yet and in poor, rural areas large parts of the population go hungry.

A combination of confusion, diarrhoea and skin changes in a sub-Saharan African setting should also prompt any clinician to rule out HIV infection. Persistent confusion in the context of HIV is commonly seen in tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or may be caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder). Both diarrhoea and skin changes of various aetiologies commonly occur in HIV infection.
