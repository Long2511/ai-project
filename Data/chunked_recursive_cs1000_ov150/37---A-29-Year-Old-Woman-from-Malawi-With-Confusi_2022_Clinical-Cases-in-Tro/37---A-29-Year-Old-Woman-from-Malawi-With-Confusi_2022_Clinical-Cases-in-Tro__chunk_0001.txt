A 29-year-old woman is brought to a hospital in Malawi by her relatives. She has been confused, restless and irritable for the past month. She also has watery diarrhoea, which started 1 week ago. She does not have a fever. It is January, which is the rainy season in Malawi.

Her past medical history has been uneventful. There have been no psychiatric disorders in the past. Her HIV status is unknown. She is not taking any medication. There are no known intoxications, no use of alcohol or recreational drugs.

The patient is married with four children. She is a house wife. Her husband works as a farmhand on a local chicken farm. They live in a grass-thatched mud-hut and collect their water from a borehole. There is no electricity at home. They eat two meals a day, mainly maize porridge with a few veg etables. Only rarely can the family afford fish or meat.
