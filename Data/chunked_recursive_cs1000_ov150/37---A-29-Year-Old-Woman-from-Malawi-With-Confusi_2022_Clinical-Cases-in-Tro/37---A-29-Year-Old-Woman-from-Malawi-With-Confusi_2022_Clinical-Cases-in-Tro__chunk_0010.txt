Patients present with the three 'Ds' of dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia. The dermatitis often presents in a typical shape around the neck, which is referred to as 'Casal's necklace' after the Spanish physician who first described it in poor peasants in the 18th century. The skin tends to be dry, tender to touch and exposure to sunlight may be very painful.

'Dementia' stands for a large spectrum of possible neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depression, hallucinations, ataxia and spastic paraparesis. A fourth 'D', death, occurs if pellagra is left untreated. The diagnosis is made clinically.
