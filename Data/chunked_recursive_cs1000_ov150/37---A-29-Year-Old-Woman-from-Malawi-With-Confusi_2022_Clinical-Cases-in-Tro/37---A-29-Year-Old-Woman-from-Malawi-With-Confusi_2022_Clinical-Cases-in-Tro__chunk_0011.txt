Treatment is with niacin or nicotinamide. Recommended doses in adults range from 50 to 400 mg daily in the acute phase. In severe cases, doses of up to 1000mg IV per day have been recommended. Once acute symptoms have settled, continuation treatment is with 50 to 150 mg niacin daily for 2 weeks. Therapy should also include other B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and a diet rich in calories. Skin lesions should be covered with soothing applications and the patient should avoid sun exposure until the lesions have resolved. Patients and their families require intense dietary counselling on how to improve their diet despite socioeconomic challenges.
