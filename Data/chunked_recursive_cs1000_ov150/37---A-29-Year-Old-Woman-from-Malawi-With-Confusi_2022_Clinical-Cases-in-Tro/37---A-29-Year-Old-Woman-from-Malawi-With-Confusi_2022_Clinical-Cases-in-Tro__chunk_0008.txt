Pellagra is a nutritional disorder caused by the deficiency of vitamin B3 or its precursor, the essential amino-acid tryptophan. 'Pellagra' is derived from the Italian pelle agra, meaning 'rough skin'. It continues to be a problem in central and southern Africa where maize is the main staple food. Maize is poor in tryptophan, which is required for niacin synthesis. In some parts of Africa white maize is mainly consumed, which is nutritionally poorer than the yellow maize used in this region as animal feed. Milling maize and removing its husks further deprives it of nutritious components. In many poor African countries with little crop diversity, diet may literally consist of just maize, whereas niacin-containing food items such as fresh fruits, vegetables, peanuts, fish, meat, milk and eggs are not affordable. Most nutritional disorders peak during the rainy season, including kwashiorkor and marasmus in children
