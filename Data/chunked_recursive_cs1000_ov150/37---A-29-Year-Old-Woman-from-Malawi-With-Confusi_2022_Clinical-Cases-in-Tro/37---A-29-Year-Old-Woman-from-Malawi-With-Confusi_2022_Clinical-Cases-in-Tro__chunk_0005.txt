A full blood count would help assess the cause of the patient's clinical anaemia. If normocytic anaemia is found, creatinine should be checked, because chronic kidney disease is very commonly seen in the tropics. Patients often present late, and both confusion and dermatitis can be signs of uraemia.

In case of a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia patients should be treated with iron and possibly also receive folic acid substitution, because a poor diet usually is not limited to just one nutritional component. ẞ-thalassaemia, commonly seen in tropical countries, also presents with microcytic anaemia and should be considered if there is no response to iron supplementation. In ẞ-thalassaemia the so-called Mentzer index (MCV [fL] : Erythrocyte count [× 1012/L]) is typically below 13; in iron deficiency it is above 13.
