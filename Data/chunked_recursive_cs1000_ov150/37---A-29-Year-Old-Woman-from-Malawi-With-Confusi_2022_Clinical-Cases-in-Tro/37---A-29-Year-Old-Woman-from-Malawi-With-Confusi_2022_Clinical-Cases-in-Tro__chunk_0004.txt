A further differential diagnosis to consider in a patient with photosensitive dermatitis, anaemia and neuropsychiatric changes is systemic lupus erythematosus.

Even though the clinical presentation is very typical of pellagra, other differential diagnoses should actively be ruled out: A diagnostic HIV test should be carried out. The fact that the patient is currently unable to receive counselling and give her consent should not lead to a delay of testing because its result determines immediate further management. Once confusion has settled, the HIV test should be repeated to include a pre- and post-counselling session. In case of a reactive HIV serology, a lumbar puncture should be done to rule out tuberculous or cryptococcal meningitis.
