The African puff-adder (Bitis arietans) is the most likely snake to have caused his bite. Puff-adders are about one metre long and stout. They show a distinctive 'V' or 'U' pat-tern on their back. When disturbed, they behave aggres-sively, hissing loudly and inflating their body. The puff-adder is a highly dangerous snake, with large quantities of a potent venom and long fangs. It commonly lives in densely populated areas. Throughout the African savannah, this spe-cies is responsible for a large number of serious bites. The main problem is massive local swelling, which may spread to involve the whole limb and cause hypovolaemic shock. Bullae filled with haemorrhagic fluid may develop at the site of the bite. Extensive necrosis may occur. Cardiotoxic effects of the venom may lead to arrhythmias, and the venom may cause systemic haemorrhage.
