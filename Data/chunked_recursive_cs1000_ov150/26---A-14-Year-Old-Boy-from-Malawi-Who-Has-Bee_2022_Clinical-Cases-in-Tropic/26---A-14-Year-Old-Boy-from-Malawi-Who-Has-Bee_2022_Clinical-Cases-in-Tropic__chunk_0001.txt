A 14-year-old Malawian boy presents to a local hospital because of an extensive necrotic wound on his right foot.
Three weeks earlier he was playing with his friends on a path leading through rocky grassland to the maize field of his family when he stepped on a snake. The snake was brown with V-shaped black bands on its back, and it was approxi-mately one metre long. His friends told his mother later that the snake had hissed loudly but did not move away before biting him - which the boy did not even realize, being busy chasing a football. Shortly after the bite, haemorrhagic bullae formed on the right leg. His gums started to bleed and he vomited extensively. He was taken to a local traditional healer for treatment. His bleeding and vomiting settled; however, he developed intense pain and swelling at the site of the bite.
