Snake bite is a common problem in rural areas of many tropical countries. The true numbers are unknown because many patients may never reach a health facility or seek the help of a traditional practitioner. Snake bites are most common among farm workers, herdsmen, plantation workers and their children. Most bites occur at the beginning of the rainy season. Even though there is a large variety of venomous snakes, the toxic effects of snake bites can be classified into one or more of seven groups.
The therapeutic approach in hospital has to consider local and systemic effects of the bite and the complications that might arise. Tetanus prophylaxis, antibiotic coverage, wound cleansing and sterile dressing are mandatory.
Antivenom should be given in case of systemic envenoming, indicated by clinical signs and symptoms or deranged laboratory parameters.
