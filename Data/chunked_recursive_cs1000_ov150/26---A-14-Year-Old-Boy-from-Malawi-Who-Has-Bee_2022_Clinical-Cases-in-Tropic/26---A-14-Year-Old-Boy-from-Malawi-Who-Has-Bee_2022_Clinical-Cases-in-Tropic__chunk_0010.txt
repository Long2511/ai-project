In humans, cytotoxic venom from African snakes can cause massive local swelling, blistering, and necrosis, as well as plasma extravasation leading to fluid loss and hypotension. Spitting cobras can also cause keratoconjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and blindness. This venom is found in puff-adders and other large Bitis species, saw-scaled vipers, burrowing asps, and spitting cobras. Auto-pharmacological venom activity releases vasoactive compounds, causing anaphylaxis, acute profound hypotension, urticaria, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and is associated with burrowing asps, Bitis species, and boomslang. Haematotoxic venom causes spontaneous systemic bleeding and is found in puff-adders, large Bitis species, saw-scaled vipers, boomslang, and vine snakes. Cardiotoxic venom leads to hypotension, shock, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities, and is delivered by puff-adders, large Bitis species, and burrowing asps
