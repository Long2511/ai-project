Antivenom should be given in case of systemic envenoming, indicated by clinical signs and symptoms or deranged laboratory parameters.
Of note, loosening of tourniquets or improvement of circulation may lead to an increased systemic load of venom. In severe local envenoming, antivenom should be given if the swelling involves more than half of the bitten limb and in patients bitten by snakes known to cause local necrosis.
Antivenom is most effective when administered by slow IV injection or infusion. Children need the same dose of antivenom as adults because the same amount of venom has been injected. Antivenom mostly consists of non-human hyperimmunoglobulin; it therefore may lead to severe side effects including fever, ana-phylaxis or late serum sickness-like reactions.
