The snake was brown with V-shaped black bands on its back, and it was approxi-mately one metre long. His friends told his mother later that the snake had hissed loudly but did not move away before biting him - which the boy did not even realize, being busy chasing a football. Shortly after the bite, haemorrhagic bullae formed on the right leg. His gums started to bleed and he vomited extensively. He was taken to a local traditional healer for treatment. His bleeding and vomiting settled; however, he developed intense pain and swelling at the site of the bite."}

Puff-adders are about one metre long and stout. They show a distinctive 'V' or 'U' pat-tern on their back. When disturbed, they behave aggres-sively, hissing loudly and inflating their body. The puff-adder is a highly dangerous snake, with large quantities of a potent venom and long fangs. It commonly lives in densely populated areas. Throughout the African savannah, this spe-cies is responsible for a large number of serious bites. The main problem is massive local swelling, which may spread to involve the whole limb and cause hypovolaemic shock. Bullae filled with haemorrhagic fluid may develop at the site of the bite. Extensive necrosis may occur. Cardiotoxic effects of the venom may lead to arrhythmias, and the venom may cause systemic haemorrhage."}

Paraceta-mol should be used for pain relief because aspirin might aggravate haemorrhage and morphine can enhance respira-tory depression caused by the venom. Any tight jewellery should be removed. The affected limb should be immobi-lized along with the whole patient, because any muscular contractions will increase the absorption of the venom.\nIf a neurotoxic venom cannot be excluded, a pressure immobilization technique should be used; e.g. a long elas-tic bandage can be wrapped around the affected limb incorporating a splint. However, in cytotoxic venoms the local effects may be worsened through such pressure techniques.\nThe wound itself should be left alone to avoid infection and absorption of the venom."}

Patients should be placed in a recovery position if vomiting or if their level of con-sciousness is reduced. All patients bitten by snakes should ideally be observed in hospital for at least 24 hours.\nFinally, helpers should not try to kill the snake, risking further bites. However, if the snake has already been killed it should be taken to the healthcare facility for identification. Even a dead snake needs to be handled with great caution as it still may bite by reflex. Smart-phone photography of the culprit snake is another alternative."}

Because the boy was septic upon admission, he was managed according to the international sepsis treatment guidelines, crucially including early start of broad-spectrum antibiotics, 'ventilatory sup-port' and fluid resuscitation. He also received tetanus prophylaxis.\nThe wound was managed surgically: After several debride-ments it stayed clean and mesh-grafting was suc-cessfully performed. Further reconstructive surgery was not necessary and severe local complications (e.g. compartment syndrome, deep tissue infection and ischaemia) did not develop. The boy was discharged several weeks later. Some functional impairment of his right foot remained and he was booked for outpatient physiotherapy."}

Spitting cobras can also cause keratoconjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and blindness. This venom is found in puff-adders and other large Bitis species, saw-scaled vipers, burrowing asps, and spitting cobras. Auto-pharmacological venom activity releases vasoactive compounds, causing anaphylaxis, acute profound hypotension, urticaria, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and is associated with burrowing asps, Bitis species, and boomslang. Haematotoxic venom causes spontaneous systemic bleeding and is found in puff-adders, large Bitis species, saw-scaled vipers, boomslang, and vine snakes. Cardiotoxic venom leads to hypotension, shock, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities, and is delivered by puff-adders, large Bitis species, and burrowing asps"}

The true numbers are unknown because many patients may never reach a health facility or seek the help of a traditional practitioner. Snake bites are most common among farm workers, herdsmen, plantation workers and their children. Most bites occur at the beginning of the rainy season. Even though there is a large variety of venomous snakes, the toxic effects of snake bites can be classified into one or more of seven groups.\nThe therapeutic approach in hospital has to consider local and systemic effects of the bite and the complications that might arise. Tetanus prophylaxis, antibiotic coverage, wound cleansing and sterile dressing are mandatory.\nAntivenom should be given in case of systemic envenoming, indicated by clinical signs and symptoms or deranged laboratory parameters."}

In severe local envenoming, antivenom should be given if the swelling involves more than half of the bitten limb and in patients bitten by snakes known to cause local necrosis.\nAntivenom is most effective when administered by slow IV injection or infusion. Children need the same dose of antivenom as adults because the same amount of venom has been injected. Antivenom mostly consists of non-human hyperimmunoglobulin; it therefore may lead to severe side effects including fever, ana-phylaxis or late serum sickness-like reactions."}

Wound infec-tion, compartment syndrome or osteomyelitis must be suspected and treated early. Skin grafts, reconstructive surgery, fasciotomy or amputation may be necessary. Massive local oedema carries the risk of hypovolaemic shock.\nIn severe haemorrhagic complications with hypotension, patients should be transfused; if blood is unavailable, sufficient IV fluids should be administered.\nFor neurotoxic complications mechanical ventilation is often required and anticholinesterase drugs should be attempted."}
