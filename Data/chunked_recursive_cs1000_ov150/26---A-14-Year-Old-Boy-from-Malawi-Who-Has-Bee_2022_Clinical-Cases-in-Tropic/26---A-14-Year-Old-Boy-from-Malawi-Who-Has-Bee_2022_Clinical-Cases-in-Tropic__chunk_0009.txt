The snake bite had occurred 3 weeks earlier, therefore appli-cation of antivenom was not deemed useful. Because the boy was septic upon admission, he was managed according to the international sepsis treatment guidelines, crucially including early start of broad-spectrum antibiotics, 'ventilatory sup-port' and fluid resuscitation. He also received tetanus prophylaxis.
The wound was managed surgically: After several debride-ments it stayed clean and mesh-grafting was suc-cessfully performed. Further reconstructive surgery was not necessary and severe local complications (e.g. compartment syndrome, deep tissue infection and ischaemia) did not develop. The boy was discharged several weeks later. Some functional impairment of his right foot remained and he was booked for outpatient physiotherapy.
