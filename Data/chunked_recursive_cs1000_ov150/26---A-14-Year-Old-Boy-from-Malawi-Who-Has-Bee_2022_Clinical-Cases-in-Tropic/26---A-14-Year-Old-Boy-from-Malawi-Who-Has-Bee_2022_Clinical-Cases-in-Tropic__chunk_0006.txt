First-aid should include reassurance of the victim. Paraceta-mol should be used for pain relief because aspirin might aggravate haemorrhage and morphine can enhance respira-tory depression caused by the venom. Any tight jewellery should be removed. The affected limb should be immobi-lized along with the whole patient, because any muscular contractions will increase the absorption of the venom.
If a neurotoxic venom cannot be excluded, a pressure immobilization technique should be used; e.g. a long elas-tic bandage can be wrapped around the affected limb incorporating a splint. However, in cytotoxic venoms the local effects may be worsened through such pressure techniques.
The wound itself should be left alone to avoid infection and absorption of the venom.
