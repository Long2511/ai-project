Necrotic wounds require careful debridement. Wound infec-tion, compartment syndrome or osteomyelitis must be suspected and treated early. Skin grafts, reconstructive surgery, fasciotomy or amputation may be necessary. Massive local oedema carries the risk of hypovolaemic shock.
In severe haemorrhagic complications with hypotension, patients should be transfused; if blood is unavailable, sufficient IV fluids should be administered.
For neurotoxic complications mechanical ventilation is often required and anticholinesterase drugs should be attempted.
