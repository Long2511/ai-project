The wound itself should be left alone to avoid infection and absorption of the venom.
The patient should gently but quickly be taken to the nearest appropriate health facility. Patients should be placed in a recovery position if vomiting or if their level of con-sciousness is reduced. All patients bitten by snakes should ideally be observed in hospital for at least 24 hours.
Finally, helpers should not try to kill the snake, risking further bites. However, if the snake has already been killed it should be taken to the healthcare facility for identification. Even a dead snake needs to be handled with great caution as it still may bite by reflex. Smart-phone photography of the culprit snake is another alternative.
