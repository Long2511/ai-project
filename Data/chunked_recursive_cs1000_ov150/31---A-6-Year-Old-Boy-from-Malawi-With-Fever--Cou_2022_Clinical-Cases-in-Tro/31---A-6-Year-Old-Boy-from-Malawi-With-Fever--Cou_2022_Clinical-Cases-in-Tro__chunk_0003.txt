Complications in measles are much more common in individuals with cellular immune defects than in the immunocompetent. Severe diarrhoea, septicaemia, giant cell pneumonia, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, encephalitis, otitis media and corneal ulcerations can complicate the course of disease. In this case, with a reduced Blantyre Coma Scale and laboured breathing, encephalitis and pulmonary involvement have to be considered.
Because the rash in this boy has only just appeared, he is still contagious and needs to be isolated and nursed in a separate room.

The boy required IV fluids, and vitamin A was given for corneal protection. Malaria treatment was stopped as smears turned out to be negative. Within the next 3 days, the rash covered the trunk and skin scaling started over the chest. The boy developed severe pneumonia and received antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral therapy was started in the out-patient-clinic.
