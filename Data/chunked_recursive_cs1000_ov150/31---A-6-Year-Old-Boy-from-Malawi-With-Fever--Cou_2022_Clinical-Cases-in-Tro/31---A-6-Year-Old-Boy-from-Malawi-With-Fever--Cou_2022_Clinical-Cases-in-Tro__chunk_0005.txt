Immunocompromised individuals may not show the rash ('white measles'), nevertheless they are highly vulnerable to developing complications. Furthermore, a sub-acute 'inclusionbody' encephalitis has been described in the immunocompromised, which occurs a few months after the acute measles infection.
A late complication after several years is subacute severe sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is invariably fatal. SSPE has an incidence of one in 10 000 to one in a million cases of measles.
The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in well-resourced settings is around 0.3 per 1000 whereas worldwide CFRs range between 3 and 5% and up to 30% in refugee settings. More than 95% of deaths occur in developing countries, mostly in children below the age of 5 years old.
