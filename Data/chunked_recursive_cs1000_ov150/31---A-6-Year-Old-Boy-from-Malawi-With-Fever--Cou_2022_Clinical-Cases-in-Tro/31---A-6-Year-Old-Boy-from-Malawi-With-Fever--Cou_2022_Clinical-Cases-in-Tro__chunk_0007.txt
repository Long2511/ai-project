Asymptomatic and not severely immunocompromised children with HIV should receive measles vaccine because the risk of severe measles complications outweighs possible side effects of the vaccine. In severely immunocompromised persons with HIV, ART should be started and measles vaccination should be delayed until immune reconstitution. However, immune response may be hampered in HIV-positive individuals, particularly if the viral load is high at the time of vaccination.
