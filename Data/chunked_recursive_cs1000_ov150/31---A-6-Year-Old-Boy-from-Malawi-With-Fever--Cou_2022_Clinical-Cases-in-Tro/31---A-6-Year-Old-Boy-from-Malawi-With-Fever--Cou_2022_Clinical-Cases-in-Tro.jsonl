The boy was admitted the night before because of high fever, dyspnoea and a dry cough which had started 3 days before. On admission, he was started on presumptive antimalarial treatment; the results of the malaria smear are pending.\nThe boy is known to be HIV-positive but is not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\nExamination reveals a sick child with a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and laboured breathing. The Blantyre coma score is 3/5. The boy has coryza and bilateral conjunctivitis. Behind both ears and on the forehead, you notice a fine maculopapular rash that has not been described before. There is bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.\n\nAn HIV-positive Malawian boy presents with high fever, dry cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and impaired level of consciousness together with a fine maculopapular rash on the neck and face."}

Also a combination of different diagnoses has to be considered, given his state of immunosuppression.\nHowever, the boy shows the three 'Cs' of \"cough, coryza and conjunctivitis\". Together with his rather conspicuous rash starting behind his ears, measles should be suspected.\nBright red spots with a whitish centre (‘Koplik's spots') on the buccal mucosa would be pathognomonic; however, they may be absent, or may appear only for a short period of time.\nOther viral infections presenting with a similar rash are rubella, enterovirus infection and infectious mononucleosis. Bacterial infections to consider include scarlet fever, meningococcal disease and rickettsial infections."}

Severe diarrhoea, septicaemia, giant cell pneumonia, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, encephalitis, otitis media and corneal ulcerations can complicate the course of disease. In this case, with a reduced Blantyre Coma Scale and laboured breathing, encephalitis and pulmonary involvement have to be considered.\nBecause the rash in this boy has only just appeared, he is still contagious and needs to be isolated and nursed in a separate room.\n\nThe boy required IV fluids, and vitamin A was given for corneal protection. Malaria treatment was stopped as smears turned out to be negative. Within the next 3 days, the rash covered the trunk and skin scaling started over the chest. The boy developed severe pneumonia and received antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral therapy was started in the out-patient-clinic."}

The course of the disease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune status of the affected individual.\nDespite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large measles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incubation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed after a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the ears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs. Severe desquamation of the skin may develop during the course of the illness. The patient is highly contagious from about 4 days before until up to 4 days after the appearance of the exanthema."}

Furthermore, a sub-acute 'inclusionbody' encephalitis has been described in the immunocompromised, which occurs a few months after the acute measles infection.\nA late complication after several years is subacute severe sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is invariably fatal. SSPE has an incidence of one in 10 000 to one in a million cases of measles.\nThe Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in well-resourced settings is around 0.3 per 1000 whereas worldwide CFRs range between 3 and 5% and up to 30% in refugee settings. More than 95% of deaths occur in developing countries, mostly in children below the age of 5 years old."}

In developing countries, all children with measles should receive vitamin A supplementation, which prevents blindness and death. Vaccination or application of human immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure may help protect non-vaccinated contacts.\nRoutine measles vaccination of children is recommended by WHO. Recent adaptations in international vaccination schedules are recommending measles vaccination in infants of 9 months of age. Almost 100% of children vaccinated with two doses of the safe live measles vaccine will have protective immunity. However, since measles is highly contagious, around 95% of a population need to be vaccinated to preserve herd immunity."}

In severely immunocompromised persons with HIV, ART should be started and measles vaccination should be delayed until immune reconstitution. However, immune response may be hampered in HIV-positive individuals, particularly if the viral load is high at the time of vaccination."}
