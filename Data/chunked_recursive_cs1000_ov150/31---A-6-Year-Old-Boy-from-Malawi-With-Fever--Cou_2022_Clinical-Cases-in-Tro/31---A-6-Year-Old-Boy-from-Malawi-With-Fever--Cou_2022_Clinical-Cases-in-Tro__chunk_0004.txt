Measles is a highly contagious viral infection, caused by a paramyxovirus and transmitted through droplets. The course of the disease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune status of the affected individual.
Despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large measles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incubation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed after a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the ears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs. Severe desquamation of the skin may develop during the course of the illness. The patient is highly contagious from about 4 days before until up to 4 days after the appearance of the exanthema.
