There is no specific antiviral treatment. In developing countries, all children with measles should receive vitamin A supplementation, which prevents blindness and death. Vaccination or application of human immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure may help protect non-vaccinated contacts.
Routine measles vaccination of children is recommended by WHO. Recent adaptations in international vaccination schedules are recommending measles vaccination in infants of 9 months of age. Almost 100% of children vaccinated with two doses of the safe live measles vaccine will have protective immunity. However, since measles is highly contagious, around 95% of a population need to be vaccinated to preserve herd immunity.
