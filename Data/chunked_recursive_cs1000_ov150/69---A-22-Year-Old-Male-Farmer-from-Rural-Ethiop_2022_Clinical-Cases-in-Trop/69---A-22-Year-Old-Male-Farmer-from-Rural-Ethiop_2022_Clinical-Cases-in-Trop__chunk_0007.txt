Neurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea. Clinical presentation is an irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement. Bladder and bowel function are maintained.

L. sativus is a hardy, high-yield pest- and insect-resistant cash crop that can endure monsoon, drought or water-logging. It has been consumed in ancient Egypt, Europe, South Asia and in the northern highlands of Ethiopia. Currently more than 100 million people in drought- and monsoon-prone areas use L. sativus as staple crop. Being a multipurpose legume, it makes a protein-rich, filling diet. It is an 'almost perfect' crop, were it not for causing disability. L. sativus contains the neurotoxin β-N-oxalyl-a,b-diaminoproprionic acid (β-ODAP), a glutamate receptor agonist that results in excitotoxicity.
