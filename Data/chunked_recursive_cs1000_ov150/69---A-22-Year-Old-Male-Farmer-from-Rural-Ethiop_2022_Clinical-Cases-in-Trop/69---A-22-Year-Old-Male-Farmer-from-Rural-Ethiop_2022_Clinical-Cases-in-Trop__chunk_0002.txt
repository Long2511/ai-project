The start of his illness coincided with a period of drought and famine, when his diet almost exclusively consisted of grass peas (Lathyrus sativus, local name guaya), which is known to be drought-resistant. Despite the monotonous diet, he had been engaged in hard physical labour on his family farm, where he was the main breadwinner, despite his young age. He lived with his mother and three sisters, who took care of household chores; they consumed a similar diet but of overall smaller amounts of guaya.

During that time, several similar cases of weakness among young male farmers occurred in his village. His walking difficulty finally meant that he could not return to farm work.
