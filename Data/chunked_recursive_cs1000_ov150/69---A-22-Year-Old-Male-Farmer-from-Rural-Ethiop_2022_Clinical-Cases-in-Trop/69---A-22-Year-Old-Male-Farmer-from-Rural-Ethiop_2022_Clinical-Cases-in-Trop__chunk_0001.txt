A 22-year-old male farmer from rural northern Ethiopia presents to a hospital in the capital with difficulty walking.

His problem started 10 years ago, when he woke from sleep one morning and noticed weakness in both legs. There was no history of trauma and no prodromal symptoms; he had been in excellent health before. The weakness in his legs rapidly progressed over 4 to 5 days, leading to him needing a cane for mobility. He had no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance or upper limb symptoms.
