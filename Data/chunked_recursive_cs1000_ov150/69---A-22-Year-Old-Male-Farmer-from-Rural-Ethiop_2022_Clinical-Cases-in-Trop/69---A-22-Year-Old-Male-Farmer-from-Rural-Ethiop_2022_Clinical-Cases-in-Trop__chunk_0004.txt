A male, teenage farmer from rural northern Ethiopia develops irreversible spastic paraparesis. The onset of symptoms coincides with a period of drought when diet mainly consists of grass peas. There is no sensory deficit and no bladder dysfunction. Another young male farmer from the same village is similarly affected.

Upper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis is the clinical syndrome. Absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level, sphincter disturbance, back pain, non-progression, HIV-seronegativity and negative family history rule out most compressive, hereditary, infectious and metabolic myelopathies.
