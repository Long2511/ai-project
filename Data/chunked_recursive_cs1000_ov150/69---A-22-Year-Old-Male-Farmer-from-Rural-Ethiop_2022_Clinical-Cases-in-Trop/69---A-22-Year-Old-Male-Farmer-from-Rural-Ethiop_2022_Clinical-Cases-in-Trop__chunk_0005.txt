Among tropical myelopathies, HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM) is highly unlikely. HAM has usually an insidious onset and a slowly progressive course, bladder impairment and sensory symptoms are prominent. Neurocassavism (konzo) may also present with a sudden-onset spastic paraparesis but is improbable in the absence of cassava exposure. Male gender, pre-onset physical exertion, excessive prolonged guaya consumption and a history of similarly affected village members favour a distinct form of toxico-nutritional disease called neurolathyrism.

Neurolathyrism is a preventable neurotoxic myelopathy leading to permanent disability. Treatment is symptomatic with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy. Tendon and muscle release surgery can be employed to lengthen contractures of calf muscles and hip adductors. Walking canes, foot braces and wheelchairs need to be provided.
