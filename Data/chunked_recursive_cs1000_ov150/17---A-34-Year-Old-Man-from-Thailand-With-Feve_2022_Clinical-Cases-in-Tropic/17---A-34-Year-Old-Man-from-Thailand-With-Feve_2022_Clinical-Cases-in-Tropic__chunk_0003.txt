Common causes of fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are infectious diseases and neoplasms.
Apart from HIV, CMV and EBV infection should be considered. All three of these viral infections may present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly and a rash, but umbilicated papular lesions are not part of the clinical picture. However, in HIV-infected individuals, mollusca contagiosa are common, which resemble the lesions seen in this patient.
Disseminated tuberculosis and infections with atypical mycobacteria are important differential diagnoses. Both can also present with cutaneous manifestations. An infection that resembles mycobacterioses in many ways is melioidosis. Melioidosis is one of the leading causes of community-acquired septicaemia in Thailand. It may present with lymphadenitis and disseminated papular skin lesions.
