He lives in Thailand and arrived in Germany only 3 days previously to visit friends.

The patient has a generalized non-pruritic rash, predominantly on his face and trunk, which consists of small umbilicated papules. There is generalized lymphadenopathy with visibly swollen lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region; his inguinal and axillary lymph nodes are also enlarged. On abdominal examination, the spleen is palpable at two fingers below the left costal margin. The liver span is 15cm in the midclavicular line.
