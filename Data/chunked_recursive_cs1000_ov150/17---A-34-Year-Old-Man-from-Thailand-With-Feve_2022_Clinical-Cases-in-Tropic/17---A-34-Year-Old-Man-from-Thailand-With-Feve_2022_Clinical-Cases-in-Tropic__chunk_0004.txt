Bartonella spp. (B. henselae, B. quintana) cause bacillary angiomatosis in immunosuppressed individuals. Bacillary angiomatosis presents with non-specific systemic symptoms and umbilicated papular skin lesions. However, these papules are usually erythematous.
Fungal infections to consider in this patient are cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and talaromycosis (previously penicilliosis), which are all commonly associated with immunosuppression but may also rarely occur in non-immunosuppressed individuals. All three may also present with umbilicated, papular skin lesions. Visceral leishmaniasis causes fever, wasting, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. It does however not cause a papular rash. It has been reported from Thailand, but appears to be uncommon.
Neoplasms to consider include lymphomas and non-malignant neoplastic conditions such as HHV-8-associated Castleman's disease.
