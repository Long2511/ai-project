A full blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 2.1 ×10⁹/L, which is below the reference range of 4–10. The haemoglobin level was 9.8 g/dL, below the reference range of 13–16. The platelet count was 110 ×10⁹/L, also below the reference range of 150–350. The C-reactive protein level was elevated at 150 mg/L, compared to the normal value of less than 5.

A 34-year-old man from Thailand presents with a 2-week history of fever and a 3-month history of wasting. On examination, he has mild hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy and a papular rash. The laboratory results reveal pancytopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein.
