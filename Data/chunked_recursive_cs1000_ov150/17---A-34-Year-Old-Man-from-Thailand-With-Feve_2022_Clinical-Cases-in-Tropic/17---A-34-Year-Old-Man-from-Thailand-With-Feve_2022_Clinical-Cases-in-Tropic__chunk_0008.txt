Talaromycosis usually affects severely immunocompromised individuals who frequently have other concurrent opportunistic infections. Patients present with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss and diarrhoea. Clinical signs are lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions can help the clinician narrow down the differential diagnosis. The papules are often located on the face, on the chest and on the extremities. Lung involvement is common and chest radiography may reveal diffuse reticulonodular or alveolar infiltrates.
Diagnosis is made by identification of the fungus by microscopy and culture. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes or bone marrow are appropriate clinical specimens. Microscopical examination reveals extracellular and intracellular yeasts. The extracellular forms often have a transverse septum as a result of binary fission.
