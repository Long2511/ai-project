Talaromycosis (previously penicilliosis) is caused by Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei, a dimorphic fungus endemic to East and South-east Asia. Incidence of talaromycosis has increased in parallel with the AIDS pandemic. It is the third commonest AIDS-related opportunistic infection in Thailand and Vietnam after tuberculosis and cryptococcosis. Talaromycosis has also been reported in immunosuppressed travellers to endemic areas. Acquisition and transmission of talaromycosis, either by inhalation or by direct inoculation, have not been fully understood; the only known hosts are humans and bamboo rats.
