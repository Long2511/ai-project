The HIV test came back positive. The patient was found to be highly immunosuppressed, with a CD4 cell count of 2/µL (normal range: 500-1000/μL).
Blood cultures were taken. A fine needle aspirate of the lymph node and a skin biopsy were performed, and the material was sent for microbiological and pathological work-up. Histopathology of the lymph node biopsy showed multiple yeast-like structures. There were no acid-fast bacilli seen. The blood culture and cultures from the skin biopsy and lymph node all grew Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei.
The diagnosis of talaromycosis was made and the patient was started on a 2-week course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole. On 3-week follow-up he was afebrile and gaining weight. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated.
