Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by the protozoan T. cruzi. It is a neglected tropical disease endemic in 21 Latin American countries with prevalence rates as high as 6.1% in Bolivia. In endemic areas, it is mainly transmitted by triatomine bugs. However, in non-endemic countries mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusions or transplants play a major role. Rarely, Chagas can be orally acquired by ingestion of food items and drinks contaminated with bug faeces.
Diagnosis in the acute phase is usually made by direct microscopic visualization of trypomastigotes on blood films. In the chronic phase when parasitaemia is low and intermittent, diagnosis relies on serological testing through detection of IgG antibodies against T. cruzi using two different tests. PCR is also used with varying sensitivities.
