There are two approved drugs for Chagas disease: benznidazole and nifurtimox. Although benznidazole is the preferred drug for Chagas disease, about 50% of patients receiving this treatment will present with adverse events. Hypersensitivity reactions with skin involvement are the most frequently observed side effects followed by gastrointestinal disturbances, bone marrow depression and peripheral neuropathy. Mild-to-moderate reactions can be solved with symptomatic treatment with or without temporal withdrawal of trypanocidal treatment. However, in about 10% of cases treatment discontinuation is definite.
Prevention relies on vector control, improving living conditions in endemic countries, screening of blood and organs for donation and screening of women of childbearing age to avoid mother-to-child transmission.
