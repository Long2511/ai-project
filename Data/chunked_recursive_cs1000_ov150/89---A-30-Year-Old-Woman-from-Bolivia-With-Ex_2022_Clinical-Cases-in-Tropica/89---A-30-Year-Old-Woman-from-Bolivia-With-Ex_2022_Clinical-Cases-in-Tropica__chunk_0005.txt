There are two trypanocidal treatments: benznidazole and nifurtimox. Treatment is always recommended for acute and congenital Chagas disease as well as for patients younger than 18 years in the chronic phase. In older patients with chronic disease, treatment is controversial. Trypanocidal treatment is usually offered to patients in the indeterminate phase with mild-to-moderate organ involvement. In order to avoid vertical transmission, guidelines usually recommend treatment of women of childbearing age.
