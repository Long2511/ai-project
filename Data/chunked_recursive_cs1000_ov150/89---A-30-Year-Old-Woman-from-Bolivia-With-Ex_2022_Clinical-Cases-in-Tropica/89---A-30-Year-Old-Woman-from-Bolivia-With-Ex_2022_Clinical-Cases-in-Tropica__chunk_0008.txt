Chagas disease has two different clinical phases. The acute phase is usually asymptomatic but can present as inflammation at the inoculation point and fever. It is followed by a chronic phase that is usually asymptomatic (indifferent phase). About 30% to 40% of patients with chronic Chagas disease will go on to develop organ involvement 10 to 20 years after initial infection.
The heart is the most frequent organ involvement, predominantly affecting conduction system and myocardium. Alterations most frequently seen include bundle branch blocks and segmental ventricular wall motion abnormalities that can progress to sinus node dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy. Gastrointestinal involvement is less common and manifestations comprise of motility disorders or megaviscera (megaoesophagus and megacolon).
