Both serological tests for Chagas disease came back positive. The patient was classified as having chagasic cardiomyopathy; and as she intended to become pregnant, antitrypanosomal therapy was offered. She started treatment with benznidazole 5 mg/kg per day for 60 days at the outpatient clinic.
Fifteen days into treatment, she presented with a pruritic maculopapular rash (Fig. 89.2) and mild eosinophilia. Benznidazole treatment was discontinued and the patient received corticosteroids and antihistamines for 5 days which lead to complete resolution of the skin rash. Re-introduction of benznidazole was tolerated well and she was able to complete the entire 60-day course without any additional problems.
Complete cardiological evaluation revealed sinus dysfunction without symptomatic bradycardia or syncope. Echocardiography showed a hypertrophic left ventricle without obstruction. Follow-up was ensured, and 5 years after, cardiac function was stable and she gave birth to a healthy child.
