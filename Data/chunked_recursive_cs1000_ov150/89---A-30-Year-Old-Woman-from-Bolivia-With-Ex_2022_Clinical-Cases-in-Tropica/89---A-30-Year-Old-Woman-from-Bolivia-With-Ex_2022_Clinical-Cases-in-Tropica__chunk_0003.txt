Following the guidelines of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), newly arrived migrants from highly endemic countries should be offered a screening panel including screening for active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and strongyloidiasis. In migrants from Latin America, especially from Bolivia, this screening panel should include Chagas disease, because prevalence rates are high and Chagas may be asymptomatic.
If a chronic phase of Chagas disease is suspected, screening is usually performed with serological testing through detection of IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi using two different serological testing methods.
