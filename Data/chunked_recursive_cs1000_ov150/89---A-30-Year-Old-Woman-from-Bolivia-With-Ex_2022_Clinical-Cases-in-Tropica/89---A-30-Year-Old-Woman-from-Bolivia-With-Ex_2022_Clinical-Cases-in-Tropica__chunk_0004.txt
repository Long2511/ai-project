The heart is the most frequently affected organ. Alterations most commonly seen include conduction disorders such as bundle branch blocks and sinus node dysfunction (Fig. 89.1). Myocardial involvement can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 89.1B). Gastrointestinal involvement is less common and manifestations comprise motility disorders or megaviscera.
As a general approach it is therefore reasonable to start with an ECG, chest x-ray and barium enema. In addition, referral to a cardiologist for echocardiography and 24-hour Holter ECG would be recommended.
