Both the reservoir and source of infection for iNTS remain unclear. S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the most common serovars, but it is unknown if the same strains cause invasive and diarrhoeal disease and if the modes of transmission are the same.
Infection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific febrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history of diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild splenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients, hepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with iNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection, with pathogens such as M. tuberculosis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.
