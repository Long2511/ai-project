S. enterica is a leading cause of community-acquired bloodstream infection in Africa and Asia. Typhoidal Salmonella species cause typhoid and paratyphoid, i.e. enteric fever. They are restricted to human hosts. Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are host generalists, colonizing and infecting a broad range of vertebrate animals.
Non-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) usually cause a self-limiting enterocolitis in immunocompetent individuals. In contrast, in subSaharan Africa (SSA) NTS commonly cause invasive disease resulting in sepsis and death. Important populations at risk for development of iNTS infection are infants and children living in areas of high transmission intensity for falciparum malaria and/or with severe malnutrition, and adults with advanced HIV-infection.
In Asia, enteric fever still prevails as a cause of invasive salmonellosis, which may be associated with the lower prevalence of iNTS risk factors in the population.
