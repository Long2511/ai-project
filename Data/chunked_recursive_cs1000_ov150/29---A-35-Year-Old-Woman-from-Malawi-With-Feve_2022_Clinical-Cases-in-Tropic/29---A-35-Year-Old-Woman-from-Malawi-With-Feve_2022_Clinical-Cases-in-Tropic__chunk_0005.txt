Other causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency, helminth infections and malaria, are less common in an HIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be considered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant women or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a microcytic anaemia.
Severe anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at times only when they are developing heart failure secondary to severe anaemia.
Visceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancytopenia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatosplenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears not to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in other parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda and Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia.
