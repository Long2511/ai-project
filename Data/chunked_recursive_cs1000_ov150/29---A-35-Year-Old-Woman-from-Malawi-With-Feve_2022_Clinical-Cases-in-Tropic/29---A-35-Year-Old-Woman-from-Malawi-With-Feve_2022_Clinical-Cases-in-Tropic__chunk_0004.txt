The patient presents with a septic picture without a clear focus; she is newly diagnosed HIV-positive and her wasting and anaemia suggest advanced immunosuppression and/or possible concomitant tuberculosis (TB).
The most common cause of sepsis in HIV-positive adults in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa is infection with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS). The slight abdominal tenderness and her splenomegaly would also fit with this diagnosis.
Enteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid) are clinically indistinguishable from infection with iNTS, they are however far less common than iNTS in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The reason for this is unclear.
Severe anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progressive 'weakness' in this patient. It is most likely a consequence of infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and possibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
