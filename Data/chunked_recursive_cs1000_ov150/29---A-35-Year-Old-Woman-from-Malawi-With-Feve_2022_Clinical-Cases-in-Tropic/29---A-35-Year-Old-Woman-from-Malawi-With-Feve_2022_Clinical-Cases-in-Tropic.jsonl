There is no cough and no night sweats, but she reports some weight loss. There is no diarrhoea, no dysuria and no history of abnormal bleeds.\nTwo months earlier she presented to a local health centre because of her weakness. She was found to be clinically pale and was prescribed iron tablets, which she took. Nevertheless, the weakness progressed. Otherwise, the patient does not report any abnormalities.\nShe is divorced, with three children (17, 15 and 12 years old), who are all well. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables on the local market. The family can afford three meals a day and occasionally meat or fish."}

The slight abdominal tenderness and her splenomegaly would also fit with this diagnosis.\nEnteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid) are clinically indistinguishable from infection with iNTS, they are however far less common than iNTS in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The reason for this is unclear.\nSevere anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progressive 'weakness' in this patient. It is most likely a consequence of infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and possibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis."}

Thalassaemia usually leads to a microcytic anaemia.\nSevere anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at times only when they are developing heart failure secondary to severe anaemia.\nVisceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancytopenia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatosplenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears not to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in other parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda and Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia."}

Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cultures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is important to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20–40ml) for culture.\nSevere anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a sign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for underlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is <100 cells/µl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) may also help confirm TB.\nOf note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient with TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine investigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on the list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a satisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or continues to lose weight."}

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started as soon as possible, once the acute infection is under control and concomitant opportunistic infections have been ruled out. The latter is important to prevent unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Her children and her current and past sexual partners should be encouraged to go for an HIV test."}

Blood cultures grew Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium. Her antibiotic treatment was changed to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg tds which was continued for 14 days. TB screening revealed prominent hilar lymph nodes and the patient was also commenced on antituberculous treatment and on antiretroviral therapy. She also received co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, vitamin B6 to prevent peripheral neuropathy and therapeutic feeding.\nShe was discharged after 4 weeks in hospital. On review in ART clinic 3 months later she was feeling much better. She had gained weight and her haemoglobin levels were picking up. Her three children tested negative for HIV.

Typhoidal Salmonella species cause typhoid and paratyphoid, i.e. enteric fever. They are restricted to human hosts. Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are host generalists, colonizing and infecting a broad range of vertebrate animals.\nNon-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) usually cause a self-limiting enterocolitis in immunocompetent individuals. In contrast, in subSaharan Africa (SSA) NTS commonly cause invasive disease resulting in sepsis and death. Important populations at risk for development of iNTS infection are infants and children living in areas of high transmission intensity for falciparum malaria and/or with severe malnutrition, and adults with advanced HIV-infection.\nIn Asia, enteric fever still prevails as a cause of invasive salmonellosis, which may be associated with the lower prevalence of iNTS risk factors in the population."}

Enteritidis are the most common serovars, but it is unknown if the same strains cause invasive and diarrhoeal disease and if the modes of transmission are the same.\nInfection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific febrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history of diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild splenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients, hepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with iNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection, with pathogens such as M. tuberculosis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection."}

Also, sensitivity of blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude of bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL). Care should therefore be taken to inoculate large enough volumes of blood for culture.\nAntimicrobial resistance among iNTS strains in Africa is increasing. Empirical management is similar to enteric fever and includes either a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, depending on the local resistance pattern and drug availability. If oral intake is not possible, a third-generation cephalosporin should be administered. Effective antibiotic treatment should be given for 10 to 14 days. Antiretroviral therapy should be started urgently to prevent relapse. The case fatality rate of patients with iNTS is much higher than in enteric fever (22–47% vs 1%)."}
