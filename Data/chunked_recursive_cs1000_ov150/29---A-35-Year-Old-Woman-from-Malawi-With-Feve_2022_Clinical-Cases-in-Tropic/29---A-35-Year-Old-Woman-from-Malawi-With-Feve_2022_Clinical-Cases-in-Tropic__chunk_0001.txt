A 35-year-old Malawian woman presents to a local hospital because of fever and weakness.
The fever started 3 days earlier, but the weakness has progressed over the past several months. There is no cough and no night sweats, but she reports some weight loss. There is no diarrhoea, no dysuria and no history of abnormal bleeds.
Two months earlier she presented to a local health centre because of her weakness. She was found to be clinically pale and was prescribed iron tablets, which she took. Nevertheless, the weakness progressed. Otherwise, the patient does not report any abnormalities.
She is divorced, with three children (17, 15 and 12 years old), who are all well. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables on the local market. The family can afford three meals a day and occasionally meat or fish.
