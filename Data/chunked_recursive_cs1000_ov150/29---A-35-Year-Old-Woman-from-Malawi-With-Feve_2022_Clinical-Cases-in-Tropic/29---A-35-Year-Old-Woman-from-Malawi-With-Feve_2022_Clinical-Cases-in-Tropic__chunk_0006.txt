Fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started immediately. Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cultures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is important to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20–40ml) for culture.
Severe anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a sign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for underlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is <100 cells/µl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) may also help confirm TB.
Of note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient with TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine investigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on the list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a satisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or continues to lose weight.
