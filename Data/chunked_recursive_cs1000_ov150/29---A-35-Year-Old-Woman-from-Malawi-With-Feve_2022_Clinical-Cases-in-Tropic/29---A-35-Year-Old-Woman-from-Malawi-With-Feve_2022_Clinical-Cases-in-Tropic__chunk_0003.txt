The malaria rapid diagnostic test is negative. The HIV serology comes back positive.

The patient's white blood cell count was 3.0 ×10^9/L, below the reference range of 4-10. Her haemoglobin was 4.8 mg/dL, which is below the reference of 12-14. The mean corpuscular volume was 90 fL, within the reference range of 80-99. Her platelet count was 112 ×10^9/L, below the reference of 150-400.

A 35-year-old Malawian woman presents in a state of sepsis without any clear focal symptoms. She is wasted and severely anaemic and she newly tests HIV-positive.
This is a very common clinical scenario in a high-prevalence setting for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
