The history, physical examination and chest radiograph findings all point to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade caused by a large pericardial effusion. The cardiovascular manifestations of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure and quiet heart sounds are indicative of pericardial effusion. The presence of syncope, pulsus paradoxus and hypotension are signs of cardiac tamponade indicating the need for a therapeutic pericardial aspiration. In Africa there are several causes of pericardial effusion that include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The presence of a previous attack of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to HIV infection, and in this case the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated tuberculosis.
