A 32-year-old man from Malawi presents to a local hospital with a history of pain in his right upper abdomen and a feeling of faintness, especially when standing up and walking. He was well until 1 month previously, when he began to experience a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission he developed pain in the right upper abdomen that was particularly apparent when sleeping on his right side. He has recently started to feel breathless on lying down and feels faint, especially on standing up. His past medical history is unremarkable, except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously that affected the right side of his abdomen around the level of the umbilicus this had healed spontaneously after several weeks.
