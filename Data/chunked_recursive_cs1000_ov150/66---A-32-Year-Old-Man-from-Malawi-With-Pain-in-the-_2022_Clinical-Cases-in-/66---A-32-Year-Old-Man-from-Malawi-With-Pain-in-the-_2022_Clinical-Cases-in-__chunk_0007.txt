. The presence of tamponade is potentially life-threatening and requires prompt pericardial aspiration. Diagnostic pericardial aspiration is usually unhelpful in the district hospital setting, because the fluid is often bloodstained and acid-fast bacilli are rarely visualized in smears of the pericardial aspirate from patients who have tuberculosis. If pericardial fluid is available for investigation, this can be examined with higher diagnostic sensitivity using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) – a fully automated and commercially available cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test - which allows a confirmed diagnosis of TB within 2 hours. The use of corticosteroids is recommended, especially if there is tamponade. In HIV-negative patients and HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy, randomized controlled trials have shown that corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death
