Blood was taken and the available results are shown. The patient's blood film is shown. The sickling test was positive and haemoglobin electrophoresis showed a homozygous HbSS-type. The wound swab grew Pseudomonas species sensitive to levofloxacin. Radiography showed a periosteal reaction with slightly sclerotic bones.

Laboratory results from the initial visit showed a white blood cell count of 17.6 ×10^9/L, which is above the reference range of 4-10, and a haemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, which is below the reference range of 13-15. Platelets were noted as adequate. The fasting blood glucose was 4.8 mmol/L, within the reference range of 4.4-6.1. Six years later, the patient's white blood cell count was 9.2 ×10^9/L, the haemoglobin was 8.3 g/dL, and the platelet count was 364 ×10^9/L, which is within the reference range of 150-400. Fasting blood glucose was not measured at that time.
