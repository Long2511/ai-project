A full blood count and a peripheral blood film should be done. In sickle cell disease, during an acute crisis, abundant sickled red cells can be seen on a blood film. Other charac- teristic but non-specific features include target cells, Howell– Jolly bodies, polychromasia and nucleated red cells. The presence of HbS can be demonstrated by using a simple sickle slide or solubility test. Blood is mixed with sodium metabisulphite, which will provoke sickling of cells contain- ing HbS; this can be demonstrated on a slide. If resources allow, confirmation is by haemoglobin electrophoresis, liquid chromatography or isoelectric focusing.

Fasting blood sugar and wound swab for culture and sen- sitivity as well as a radiograph of the left leg should be done to rule out other differential diagnoses and osteomyelitis.
