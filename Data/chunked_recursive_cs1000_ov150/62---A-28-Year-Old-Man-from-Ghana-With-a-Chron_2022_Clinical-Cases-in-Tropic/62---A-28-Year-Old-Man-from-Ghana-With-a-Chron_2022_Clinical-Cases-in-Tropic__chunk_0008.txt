Of the many treatments, the most certain to aid healing is complete bed rest with leg elevation. Oral zinc sulphate tablets (200 mg tid) have been shown to be helpful. Systemic antibiotic therapy is given in acute sepsis. The use of hydroxyurea in leg ulcers is controversial. Chronic transfusion regimens to maintain the haemoglobin level above 10g/dL may help when conser- vative therapy fails. Skin grafting for clean wounds is recom- mended, especially when the defect is large. The relapse rate is high, however. Poor nutrition which has not been given much attention may be a crucial factor and needs to be investigated on a wide scale in sickle cell disease.
