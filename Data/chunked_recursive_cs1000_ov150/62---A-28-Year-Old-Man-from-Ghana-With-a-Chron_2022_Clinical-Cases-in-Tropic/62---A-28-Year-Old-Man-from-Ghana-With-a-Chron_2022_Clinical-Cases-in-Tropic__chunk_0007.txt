The disease is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage. Any organ can be affected by SCD at any age; however, certain features tend to predominate in certain age-groups. Leg ulcers tend to manifest in adulthood. Pathophysiology is complex and remains incompletely understood. Ulcers in SCD occur in areas with thin skin and little subcutaneous fat, most commonly on the ankles.

They are notoriously difficult to treat. The ulcers are slow to heal and are characterized by unexplained relapses. They are com- monly very painful and patients may occasionally require opioids for pain control. Colonization with pathogenic bacteria is com- mon. Periosteal reaction is usually seen in the underlying bones but osteomyelitis is uncommon.
