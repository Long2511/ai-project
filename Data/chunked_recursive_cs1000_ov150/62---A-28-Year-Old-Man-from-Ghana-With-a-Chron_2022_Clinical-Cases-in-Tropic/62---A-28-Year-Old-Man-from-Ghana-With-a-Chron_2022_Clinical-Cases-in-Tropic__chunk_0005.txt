The diagnosis made was sickle cell disease with a chronic ankle ulcer. The patient was managed with alternate daily wound dressing using normal saline irrigation and povi- done-iodine. High white cell counts are commonly seen in sickle cell disease. They may be the result of bone marrow stimulation and do not necessarily indicate systemic infec- tion. However, in view of the patient's generally poor condi- tion and the Pseudomonas grown from his wound swab, it was decided to give him systemic antibiotic treatment.

Strict bed rest was difficult to enforce because the young man was self-employed and could not afford to take the required time off work. His recurrent bone pain was man- aged conservatively with good hydration, prompt treatment of infections and relief of other identifiable precipitants of crises. He received daily folic acid supplementation. Pain relief was achieved with paracetamol and tramadol.
