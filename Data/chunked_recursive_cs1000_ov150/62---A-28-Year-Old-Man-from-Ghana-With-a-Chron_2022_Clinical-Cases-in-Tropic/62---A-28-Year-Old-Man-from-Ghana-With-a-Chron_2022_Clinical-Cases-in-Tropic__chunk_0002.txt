The chronic nature of the ulcer, its site and the surrounding hyperpigmentation make a venous ulcer likely. The patient's bone pain, jaundice and pallor could point to a haemolytic anaemia. Various hereditary haemolytic anaemias may be complicated by chronic leg ulceration, e.g. haemoglobinopa- thies (thalassaemia and sickle cell disease), spherocytosis and pyruvate kinase deficiency. In the West African context, sickle cell disease is the most likely diagnosis.

Further differentials would be tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer or chronic osteomyelitis with a discharging sinus. Bur- uli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is usually pain- less. Other mycobacterial infections can also present with chronic skin ulcers. Pyoderma gangrenosum and malignant diseases also need to be considered.
