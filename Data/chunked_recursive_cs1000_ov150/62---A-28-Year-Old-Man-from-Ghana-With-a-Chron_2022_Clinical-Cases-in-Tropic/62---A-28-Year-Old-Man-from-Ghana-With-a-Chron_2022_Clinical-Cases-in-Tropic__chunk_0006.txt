However, on follow-up 3 years later, the ulcer was still not healed. Grafting was under consideration, when healthy granulation tissue would be achieved.

Six years later, the wound had still not healed and the patient could not afford a skin graft. He had 3 times weekly dressing and felt well in himself. His WBC was normal and his Hb had slightly increased.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of autosomal- codominant genetic disorders characterized by the production of abnormal sickle haemoglobin S (HbS). Homozygous HbSS leads to sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form of SCD. Sickle cell disease is the commonest hereditary haematological disorder.

HbS has the tendency to polymerize during hypoxia. This leads to a reduction of the flexibility of the erythrocyte and to the typical sickle shape of the affected cell. Sickled red blood cells lead to haemolysis and vaso-occlusion.
