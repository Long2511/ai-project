The patient progressed to shock. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and required treatment with vasopressors. Blood films were negative for malaria. However, the thin film revealed massive red blood cell infestation by pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures compatible with B. bacilliformis (Fig. 52.1). Blood cultures were negative, including cultures in special media for Bartonella. The patient was started on a combination of intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone for 10 days. Altered mental status resolved after 3 days of antimicrobial treatment and fever subsided after 5 days. By day 4 the bacteria had disappeared from the blood smears. No further complications were observed during a 3-month follow-up period.
