After acute Oroya fever, within 1 to 2 months a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') may occur in approximately 5% of treated patients and in an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Occasionally, verruga peruana is seen without noticeable acute-phase manifestations. It is mostly seen in children in endemic areas. Skin lesions are usually small (1–4 mm), red-violaceous, painless papules located on the face or the extremities, and can be single or multiple (Fig. 52.2). Nodular lesions can also be observed. The lesions resemble bacillary angiomatosis caused by B. quintana and B. henselae.

In the acute phase, diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells. B. bacilliformis is a fastidious bacterium, and culture requires a specific medium incubated at 25 to 28°C for up to 2 weeks.
