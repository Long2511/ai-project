Recommended treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. These antimicrobials also cover for Salmonella species, the commonest opportunistic infection observed in these patients. Increased antibiotic resistance of both B. bacilliformis and concomitant opportunistic pathogens has been observed and should be sought in the absence of a clinical response. Oral azithromycin is the drug of choice for verruga peruana. Alternatively, ciprofloxacin can be used.

Oroya fever is also named Carrion's disease after a famous Peruvian medical student, Daniel Carrion, who in 1885 inoculated himself with fluid obtained of a wart from a patient with verruga peruana and developed acute bartonellosis (Oroya fever). He unfortunately died from the disease. However, his experiment demonstrated clearly that verruga peruana and Oroya fever were different clinical forms of the same infection.
