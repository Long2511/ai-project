Bartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru at an altitude between 500 and 3200 metres, although transmission may occur at higher altitudes and in jungle areas as well. Colombia and Ecuador have also reported sporadic cases. The disease is transmitted by female sandflies, mostly Lutzomyia verrucarum or L. peruensis, which characteristically bite indoors at nighttime. Human beings are the only known reservoir. Non-vectorial B. bacilliformis transmission from mother to child or through blood transfusions has been described but remains scarce. Most infections are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. However, a minority of patients progress to severe disease ('Oroya fever') after a mean incubation period of 3 to 8 weeks (longer incubation periods up to 9 months have been observed). Oroya fever is characterized by high fever, malaise, myalgias and severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice
