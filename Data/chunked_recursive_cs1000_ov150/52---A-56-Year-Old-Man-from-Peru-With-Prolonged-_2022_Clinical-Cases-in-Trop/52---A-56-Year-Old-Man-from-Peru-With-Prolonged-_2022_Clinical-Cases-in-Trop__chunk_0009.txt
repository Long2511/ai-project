. Oroya fever is characterized by high fever, malaise, myalgias and severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice. Complications during this acute phase include heart failure, as well as pericardial and pleural effusions. CNS involvement, characterized by impaired consciousness, agitation and coma, occurs in approximately 20% of patients and is associated with higher case fatality rates. Secondary immunosuppression may occur during this phase and patients may present with opportunistic infections similar to those seen in advanced HIV-infection, e.g. salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
