A 56-year-old male Peruvian is admitted to a hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-week history of fever, jaundice and confusion.

In the second week of illness the patient noticed dark urine and jaundice, and few days before admission his wife noticed confusion and somnolence. While in the rural area, the patient and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes; no personal protection was used. Otherwise there has been no animal contact. The past medical history is unremarkable.
