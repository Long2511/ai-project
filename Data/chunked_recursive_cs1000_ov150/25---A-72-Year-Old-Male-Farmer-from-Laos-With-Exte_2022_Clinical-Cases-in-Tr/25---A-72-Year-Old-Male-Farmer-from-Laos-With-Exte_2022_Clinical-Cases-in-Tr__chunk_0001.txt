A 72-year-old male farmer is admitted to a provincial hospital in northern Laos with extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on his left foot and lower leg.

Ten years prior, he had a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week later a small painless red nodule developed at the site of the bite. Over the following years the lesion slowly increased in size; further lesions developed and spread up to his knee. Three days before admission his ankle became painful and swollen.

Vital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile. His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen; the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.

Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement.
