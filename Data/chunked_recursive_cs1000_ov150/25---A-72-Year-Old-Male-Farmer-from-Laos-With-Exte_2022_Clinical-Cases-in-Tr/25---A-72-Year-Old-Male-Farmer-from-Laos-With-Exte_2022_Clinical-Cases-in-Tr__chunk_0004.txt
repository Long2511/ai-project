In leprosy, slit skin smears are fairly easy to obtain; however, for other mycobacterial infections biopsy and/or culture may be necessary.

Secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and so iodine-based antiseptics were applied locally and oral antibiotics were started, initially cloxacillin and metronidazole. After bacterial culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli, antibiotics were changed to co-trimoxazole, guided by susceptibility testing.
