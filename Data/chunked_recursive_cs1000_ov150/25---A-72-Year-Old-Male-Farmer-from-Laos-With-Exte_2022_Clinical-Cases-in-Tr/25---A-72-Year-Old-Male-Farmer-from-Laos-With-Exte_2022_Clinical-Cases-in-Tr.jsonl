One week later a small painless red nodule developed at the site of the bite. Over the following years the lesion slowly increased in size; further lesions developed and spread up to his knee. Three days before admission his ankle became painful and swollen.\n\nVital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile. His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen; the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.\n\nRadiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement."}

The affected leg has additionally swollen up and become painful over the previous 3 days.\n\nChronic verrucous skin lesions can typically be seen in fungal infections such as sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenckii) and chromoblastomycosis, which is caused by various pigmented fungi. Mycetoma (“Madura Foot”) is a chronic subcutaneous infection caused either by fungi (“eumycetoma\") or actinomycetes (“actinomycetoma”). Fistulating lesions discharging granules are the hallmark feature of madura foot but verrucous manifestations may occur. The colour of the granules may indicate the causing pathogen. Despite being common in other parts of Asia, Mycetoma has rarely been described from Laos."}

Cutaneous leishmaniasis can present with verrucous lesions, however it has not been reported in Laos. In HIV-positive patients, Kaposi's Sarcoma may look very similar.\n\nNon-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema and psoriasis should be borne in mind.\n\nAcute localized inflammatory signs are indicative of bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.\n\nDirect microscopy of skin scrapings taken from the lesions can help detect pigmented fungi in chromoblastomycosis and may be useful to visualize amastigotes in cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n\nSporotrichosis differs from the other subcutaneous mycoses in that culture is the most reliable mode of diagnosis because there are few organisms present in lesions and these may be difficult to find."}

After bacterial culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli, antibiotics were changed to co-trimoxazole, guided by susceptibility testing."}

Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solution made the fungal cells more readily visible. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days monthly pulse therapy) and surgical debridement of all lesions performed. PCR from skin tissue was positive and sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. When oral terbinafine could be obtained this was added (initially 500 mg/d, later 750 mg/d) for 9 months and local terbinafine ointment was applied for 6 months. Liver function tests and serum glucose were monitored during treatment and remained normal. The lesions healed uneventfully with some residual swelling and hypopigmentation."}
