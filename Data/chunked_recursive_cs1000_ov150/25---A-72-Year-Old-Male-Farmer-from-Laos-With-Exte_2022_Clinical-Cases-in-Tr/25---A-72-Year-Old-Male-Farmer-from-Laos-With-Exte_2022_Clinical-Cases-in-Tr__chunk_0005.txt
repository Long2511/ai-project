Simple direct microscopic investigations of wet film lesion scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis. Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solution made the fungal cells more readily visible. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days monthly pulse therapy) and surgical debridement of all lesions performed. PCR from skin tissue was positive and sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. When oral terbinafine could be obtained this was added (initially 500 mg/d, later 750 mg/d) for 9 months and local terbinafine ointment was applied for 6 months. Liver function tests and serum glucose were monitored during treatment and remained normal. The lesions healed uneventfully with some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.
