Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement.

A male Lao farmer presents with several verrucous, partially fungating skin lesions on his left leg and foot, which have been growing over the past 10 years after a minor trauma. The affected leg has additionally swollen up and become painful over the previous 3 days.

Chronic verrucous skin lesions can typically be seen in fungal infections such as sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenckii) and chromoblastomycosis, which is caused by various pigmented fungi. Mycetoma (“Madura Foot”) is a chronic subcutaneous infection caused either by fungi (“eumycetoma") or actinomycetes (“actinomycetoma”). Fistulating lesions discharging granules are the hallmark feature of madura foot but verrucous manifestations may occur. The colour of the granules may indicate the causing pathogen. Despite being common in other parts of Asia, Mycetoma has rarely been described from Laos.
