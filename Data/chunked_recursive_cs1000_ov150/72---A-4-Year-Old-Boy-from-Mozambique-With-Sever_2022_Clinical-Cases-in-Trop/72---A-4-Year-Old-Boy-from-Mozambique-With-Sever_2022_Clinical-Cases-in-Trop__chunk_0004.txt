The child needs to be admitted to the high dependency area of the nutrition ward and treated according to WHO guidelines for severe acute malnutrition with meticulously calculated amounts of feeds and close monitoring. The risks of infection, diarrhoea, anaemia, cardiac and liver failure are high. Prophylactic antibiotics, monitoring of temperature and haemoglobin as well as careful fluid replacement, are part of the treatment scheme.

The skin in the groin and armpits continued to peel off and became superinfected. The lesions could successfully be treated with Gentian violet solution.
Initially the child did not tolerate 3-hourly feeds and required feeding through a nasogastric tube. On day 5 in the nutrition rehabilitation unit he could eat by himself and the oedema started to settle. The transition to higher caloric feeds was tolerated well and he could be discharged into the community feeding program at day 15.
