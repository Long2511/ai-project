An oedematous, HIV-negative 4-year-old boy from rural Mozambique is seen at the paediatric department of a central hospital in Malawi.
He was admitted 5 days earlier with the suspected diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and was started on furosemide and prednisolone; however, his oedema did not subside.
Three weeks earlier he had been treated for pneumonia at a health centre.

The little boy is miserable, refusing to eat and apathetic with a puffy face and pitting oedema on the lower legs. His hair is brittle, sparse and fair in colour. The skin is dry and hyperpigmented; it is peeling off like 'flaky paint' and there are ulcerative skin lesions, most prominently in the groins.

The patient's albumin was 2.2 g/dL, below the reference range of 3.0–5.2 g/dL, and his haemoglobin was 7 g/dL, below the reference range of 12-14g/dL.

1. What is the likely diagnosis and how can it be distinguished from nephrotic syndrome?
2. How should the child be treated and what is the prognosis?
