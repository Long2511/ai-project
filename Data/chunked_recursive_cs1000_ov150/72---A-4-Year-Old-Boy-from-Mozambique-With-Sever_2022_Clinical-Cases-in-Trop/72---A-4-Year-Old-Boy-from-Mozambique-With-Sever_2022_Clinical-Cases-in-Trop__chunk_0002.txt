Three weeks after a severe bacterial infection, a 4-year old boy from rural Mozambique develops oedema. The skin is hyperpigmented and dry, peeling off and there is discoloration of his hair. Treatment with furosemide has no influence on the extent of the oedema. Clinically, the little boy is sick and refusing to eat or drink. He is anaemic and his serum albumin is low.
