His hair is brittle, sparse and fair in colour. The skin is dry and hyperpigmented; it is peeling off like 'flaky paint' and there are ulcerative skin lesions, most prominently in the groins.\n\nThe patient's albumin was 2.2 g/dL, below the reference range of 3.0–5.2 g/dL, and his haemoglobin was 7 g/dL, below the reference range of 12-14g/dL.\n\n1. What is the likely diagnosis and how can it be distinguished from nephrotic syndrome?\n2. How should the child be treated and what is the prognosis?"}

The skin is hyperpigmented and dry, peeling off and there is discoloration of his hair. Treatment with furosemide has no influence on the extent of the oedema. Clinically, the little boy is sick and refusing to eat or drink. He is anaemic and his serum albumin is low."}

In nephrotic syndrome, serum albumin is low and there is heavy proteinuria. Low serum albumin is however influenced by many factors such as nutrition, liver function and intestinal resorption.\nThis child is displaying additional clinical features such as skin and hair changes as well as apathy. These are typical features of kwashiorkor, a form of severe acute malnutrition.\nA urine dipstick test should be done to check for protein. In nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria exceeds 3.5 g per day (4 + on a urine dipstick) and the urine is often macroscopically frothy. In kwashiorkor, some proteinuria may be found but rarely exceeds 1 + on a dipstick test."}

The risks of infection, diarrhoea, anaemia, cardiac and liver failure are high. Prophylactic antibiotics, monitoring of temperature and haemoglobin as well as careful fluid replacement, are part of the treatment scheme.\n\nThe skin in the groin and armpits continued to peel off and became superinfected. The lesions could successfully be treated with Gentian violet solution.\nInitially the child did not tolerate 3-hourly feeds and required feeding through a nasogastric tube. On day 5 in the nutrition rehabilitation unit he could eat by himself and the oedema started to settle. The transition to higher caloric feeds was tolerated well and he could be discharged into the community feeding program at day 15."}
