Generalized oedema in a child can have various causes. In nephrotic syndrome, serum albumin is low and there is heavy proteinuria. Low serum albumin is however influenced by many factors such as nutrition, liver function and intestinal resorption.
This child is displaying additional clinical features such as skin and hair changes as well as apathy. These are typical features of kwashiorkor, a form of severe acute malnutrition.
A urine dipstick test should be done to check for protein. In nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria exceeds 3.5 g per day (4 + on a urine dipstick) and the urine is often macroscopically frothy. In kwashiorkor, some proteinuria may be found but rarely exceeds 1 + on a dipstick test.
