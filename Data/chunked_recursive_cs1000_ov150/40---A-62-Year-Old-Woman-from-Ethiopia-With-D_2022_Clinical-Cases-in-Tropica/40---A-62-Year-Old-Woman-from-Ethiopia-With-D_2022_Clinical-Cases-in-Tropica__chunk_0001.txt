A 62-year-old woman from rural Ethiopia had flown to Europe to visit her daughter and meet her new grandchild. She was normally fit and well and very physically active, because she worked on her smallholding in Ethiopia. Three days after arrival she began to find it difficult to chew, with what she described through her daughter as 'stiffness of the mouth'. This had never happened before.

No abnormal findings are discovered on examination. Her pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate are within normal limits.
