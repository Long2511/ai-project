Severe tetanus is a terrible disease both to have and to witness. Some tetanus stops at trismus, but most will go on to generalized spasms. As these become more severe, respiratory function is compromised; and in the most severe cases, there is autonomic dysregulation with rapid swings in blood pressure, heart rate and pulse. There is a wide variation in the mortality from established generalized tetanus between different units, demonstrating that proper medical and nursing care have a significant influence on outcome. Wounds require meticulous cleaning and debridement. After the initial antibiotics, antitoxin and diazepam (for spasms), it is essential to assess the stage of the patient regularly. Tetanus toxin already in the motor nerves will not be affected by antitoxin and will continue to track to the spinal cord, therefore patients generally continue to deteriorate for several days after initial presentation and treatment
