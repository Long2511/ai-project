Although there is a range of possible causes of stiffness on mastication, the main cause from less developed countries is early tetanus. The risk factors are agricultural work and being from a country and age group in which vaccination is unlikely to have occurred. An important differential for trismus in older people is giant cell arteritis (GCA), and an ESR should be performed on this woman to exclude GCA as a matter of urgency, although she is towards the lower end of the age range for this.

The diagnosis of tetanus is purely clinical. Generalized tetanus with spasms is easy to diagnose once it is established, but it is usually preceded by trismus because the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.
