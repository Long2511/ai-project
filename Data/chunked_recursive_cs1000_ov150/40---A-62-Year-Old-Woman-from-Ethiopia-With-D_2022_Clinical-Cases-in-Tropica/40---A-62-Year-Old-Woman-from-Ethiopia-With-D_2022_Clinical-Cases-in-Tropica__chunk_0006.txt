. Intrathecal antitoxin should be considered in severe cases. In survivors, the disease then plateaus before a slow recovery. Most deaths are either from laryngeal spasm (rapid), respiratory arrest in prolonged spasms, cardiac dysrhythmia or chest infection. Increased respiratory rate (over 40 breath cycles per minute) or difficulty swallowing should make the treating physician consider the risk of laryngeal spasm and prepare the patient for either elective tracheotomy or paralysis and ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because of the protracted course of tetanus, weaning from ventilators once started is slow and difficult, with all the complications that a prolonged stay in an ICU brings.
