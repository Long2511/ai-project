The initial treatment for any possible tetanus is to give an antibiotic (metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice) to kill the infection and prevent more toxin production, and an antitoxin injection to neutralize circulating tetanospasmin. The earlier this is undertaken the better the outlook; therefore it is better to over-suspect tetanus than to wait until spasms make the diagnosis obvious.

The time between the high-risk injury and the first symptoms is a guide to prognosis but often it is not known, especially in agricultural populations who may sustain high-risk injuries (which may be minor) regularly.
