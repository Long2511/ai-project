The woman received metronidazole and antitoxin on day 1. On day 2 she presented again, having had two generalized spasms. Over the next 2 days she was nursed in a dark, quiet environment, but her spasms increased in frequency, severity and duration over the next 5 days and she developed dysphagia. She was treated with diazepam and antitoxin was administered intrathecally. A prophylactic tracheotomy was performed because of the risk of laryngeal spasms, the commonest cause of sudden death in tetanus. Her symptoms got no worse after 7 days; she did not have to be paralysed and ventilated, and her respiration was not severely compromised at any point. She made a slow recovery over 3 weeks, and was still experiencing stiffness when seen in clinic 3 months later.
