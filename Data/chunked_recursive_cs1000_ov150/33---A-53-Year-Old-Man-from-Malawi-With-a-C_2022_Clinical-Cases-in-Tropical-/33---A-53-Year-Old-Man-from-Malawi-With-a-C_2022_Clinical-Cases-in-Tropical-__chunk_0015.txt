In patients who are HIV-negative or have a high CD4 count over 200/μL, TB presentation includes a severe, productive cough, and haemoptysis is common. In contrast, for patients with a low CD4 count below 200/μL, the cough is often mild with small amounts of whitish sputum, and haemoptysis is rare. Regarding chest radiography, patients with a high CD4 count typically show cavities, upper lobe infiltrates, and destruction, whereas patients with a low CD4 count have no cavities and may present with infiltrates, hilar lymphadenopathy, a miliary pattern, or a completely normal radiograph. The sputum smear result is often positive in high CD4 count patients but often negative in those with a low count. Extrapulmonary and disseminated TB occurs in less than 20% of TB cases in patients with high CD4 counts but is common in about 50% of cases in patients with low CD4 counts.
