Ultrasound is also very useful and simple to look for signs of extrapulmonary/disseminated TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression. Simple and very useful algo- rithms have been published to guide clinicians not ultrasound-experienced in the diagnosis of TB.
If none of these investigations is available, it is well justi- fiable to empirically start the patient on antituberculous treatment, because sputum smear-negative TB is common and fatal if untreated. Adding prednisolone for the first 4 weeks of antituberculous treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of immune-reconstitution inflamma- tory syndrome (IRIS).
