A 53-year-old Malawian man presents to a local hospital with a productive cough and whitish sputum for 3 months. He also reports night sweats and some weight loss, which he is unable to quantify.
Two months earlier he presented to a health centre with the same complaints. He was given presumptive antimalar- ials and amoxicillin for 5 days, but to no avail.
The patient is not aware of any tuberculosis (TB) con- tacts. He is currently not on any medication and his past medical history is unremarkable. He is a subsistence farmer. He has never worked in a mine or in the construction indus- try. He is a non-smoker. He is married with five children; all are well.
