The HIV-test is reactive. His further laboratory results are shown in Table 33.1.

On admission, the patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 x10⁹/L, which was below the reference range of 4-10. His haemoglobin was 9.8 g/dL, also below the reference range of 13-15. The mean corpuscular volume was 90 fL and the platelet count was 305 x10⁹/L, both of which were within their normal reference ranges of 80-98 and 150-350, respectively. The CD4 count was 54 cells/µL, significantly below the reference of 500-1200. Two sputum tests for AFB were negative. Both the Malaria RDT and the thick smear for Plasmodium spp. were also negative.

His chest radiograph on admission shows a prominent hilar region bilaterally but is otherwise normal (Fig. 33.1).
