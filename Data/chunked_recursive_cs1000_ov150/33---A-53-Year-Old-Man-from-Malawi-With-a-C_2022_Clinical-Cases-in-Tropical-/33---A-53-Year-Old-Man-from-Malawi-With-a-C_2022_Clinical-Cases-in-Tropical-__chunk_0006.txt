The fact that the patient does not report any TB contact should not be overvalued. Firstly, TB in immunosuppression is often a consequence of reactivation and the primary infec- tion may have been decades ago. Secondly, in resource-limited countries, practically everyone is exposed to TB – this could occur during a ride on an overcrowded minibus or when con- gregating with friends and family in someone's small home.
Given the fact that our patient is in an advanced stage of immunosuppression and has not taken any co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, an alternative or possibly co-existing diagnosis to consider is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A concomitant bacterial chest infection is possible but unlikely to explain the whole 3 months of illness.
