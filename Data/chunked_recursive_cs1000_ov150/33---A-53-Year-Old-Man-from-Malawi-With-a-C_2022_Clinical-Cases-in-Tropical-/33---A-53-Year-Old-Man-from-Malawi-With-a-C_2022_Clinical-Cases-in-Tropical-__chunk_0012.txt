The patient was treated for a possible bacterial chest infec- tion, covering also for Gram-negative bacteria. He received ceftriaxone 2g IV od and erythromycin 500mg qid for 5 days. It was decided not to treat him for PCP and he received the prophylactic dose of co-trimoxazole (480 mg bid according to local national guidelines). Nonetheless, his fever persisted, even though the cough subjectively improved slightly.
On day 7 in the hospital, the patient was started on empir- ical treatment for smear-negative TB with four antitubercu- lous drugs (Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (P) and Ethambutol (E)). After the first week of treatment, he started to feel better. His fever went down and the cough gradually settled. He was discharged home. Three weeks into the TB treatment he was seen at the HIV clinic. He was doing well and had started antiretroviral therapy.
