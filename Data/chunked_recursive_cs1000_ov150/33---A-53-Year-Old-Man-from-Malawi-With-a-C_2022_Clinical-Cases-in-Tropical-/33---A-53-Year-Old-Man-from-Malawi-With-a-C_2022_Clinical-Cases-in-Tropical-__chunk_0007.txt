Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) of the lung is another differential diagnosis to consider, but patients with pulmonary KS usu- ally have manifestations of KS elsewhere (skin, oral mucosa). On chest radiography of patients with pulmonary KS, patchy infiltrations are commonly seen in the lower lung zones. Nei- ther was the case in our patient, which makes this diagnosis unlikely.
Pulmonary malignancy or pulmonary sarcoidosis, which would be high on the list of differential diagnoses in indus- trialized countries, are much less likely than an infectious cause in the given setting.
Apart from chest infections, Gram-negative sepsis second- ary to invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) needs to be considered in this febrile and anaemic patient with advanced immunosuppression.
