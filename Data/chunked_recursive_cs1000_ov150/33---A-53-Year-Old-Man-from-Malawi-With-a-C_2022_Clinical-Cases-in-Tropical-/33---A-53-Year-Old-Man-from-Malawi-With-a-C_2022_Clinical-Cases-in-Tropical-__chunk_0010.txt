Additional antibiotic treatment should be considered in this febrile patient with advanced immunosuppression. If available, blood cultures should be taken in any febrile patient before starting antibiotic treatment. Also, adding high-dose co-trimoxazole to antituberculous therapy as pre- sumptive treatment for PCP has to be considered if the patient does not clinically improve. The optimal timing to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/µl.
