Induced sputum should be examined for acid-fast bacilli. Real-time PCR-based tests such as XPert MTB/RIF are easy to use, more sensitive than microscopy and also help detect rifampicin resistance. Thanks to an endorsement by WHO and international donor support, XPert MTB/ RIF is increasingly available even at remote hospitals in rural areas.
Mycobacterial cultures of the sputum should be done but results will take several weeks, too long to guide the clini- cian's imminent decision.
Ideally, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should be done and material assessed for M. tuberculosis (PCR, cul- ture, microscopy) and Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCR, micros- copy). Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma could also be diagnosed on endoscopy.
Urine lipoarabinomannan (urine-LAM) is a simple lateral-flow assay helpful to look for TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 <100/µl). A positive test indicates disseminated TB with renal involvement.
