In all HIV-positive patients with cough and weight loss who do not respond to antibiotic therapy, tuberculosis is top of the list of differential diagnoses. In this case the most likely diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary TB.
TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression often presents with a clinical picture that is very different from immunocompetent individuals: sputum smear-negative TB, which is uncommon in HIV-negative patients, is com- monly seen in HIV-infected patients, particularly if immu- nosuppression is advanced as in this case. The slightly prominent hilar region seen on the patient's chest radiograph is compatible with the intrathoracic lymphadenopathy: typ- ical though not specific for TB. Physical examination of the chest is normal in about half of HIV patients with pulmonary TB.
