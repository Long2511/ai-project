The stools resemble diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. Her husband reports that she became unresponsive about an hour previously and he hired a rickshaw to bring her to the hospital. He says that she had not complained of pain and did not have fever.\n\nThe patient has recently attended a religious festival, where water was supplied in large metal containers. Her husband reports that there were five or six people who had attended the same event and were also ill with diarrhoea.\n\nA thin young woman, who is stuporous and responds minimally to a painful stimulus (GCS 9/15). She is afebrile, with sunken eyes, dry mouth and a scaphoid abdomen. A skin pinch returns very slowly. Her pulse rate is 110 bpm, low volume, and her blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg. The remainder of her systemic examination is normal."}

However, several values were outside normal ranges: the potassium level was low at 3.0 mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and the bicarbonate level was also low at 11.4 mmol/L (reference range 23-28 mmol/L). Conversely, venous lactic acid was high at 4.1 mmol/L (reference range 0.67-1.8 mmol/L), as were creatinine at 203 µmol/L (reference range 62-115 µmol/L) and blood urea nitrogen at 8.6 mmol/L (reference range 2.9-7.1 mmol/L).\n\nMacroscopic: Liquid stool, rice-water appearance with no faecal matter.

There is no fever, vomiting or abdominal pain. She is severely dehydrated and her electrolytes are deranged. The microscopic examination of her stool indicates cholera which is confirmed on culture. A number of other people who attended the same festival have also fallen ill with diarrhoea.\n\nCholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and urban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited, including refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as well as times of political and social unrest associated with a collapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera."}

The clinical assessment of dehydration in patients with suspected cholera is categorized into three levels. For no dehydration, meaning less than 5% fluid loss, the patient is well and alert, has normal eyes, drinks normally, has instantaneous skin turgor recoil, and a normal pulse. For some dehydration, representing 5-10% fluid loss, the patient is restless and irritable, has sunken eyes, is thirsty and drinks eagerly, has non-instantaneous skin turgor recoil, and a rapid, low-volume pulse. For severe dehydration, with over 10% fluid loss, the patient is lethargic or unconscious, has sunken eyes, drinks poorly or is unable to drink, has a very slow skin turgor recoil of over 2 seconds, and a weak or absent pulse. Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration"}

Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration. The approach to rehydration depends on the degree of dehydration. For patients with no dehydration (less than 5% fluid loss), fluid replacement is needed only for ongoing losses, administered orally, and timed based on the patient's thirst. Monitoring involves observing the patient until ongoing losses can be adequately replaced by an oral rehydration solution (ORS). For patients with some dehydration (5-10% fluid loss), the requirement is 75 mL/kg in the first 24 hours in addition to ongoing losses, administered orally or intravenously. Fluids should be replaced over 3-4 hours, and the patient should be observed every 1-2 hours until all signs of dehydration resolve and they urinate"}

Patients with severe cholera present with a higher degree of initial dehydration, have more rapid continuing losses and proportionately greater electrolyte depletion than patients with other forms of gastroenteritis. The most common error is for clinicians to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required for rehydration.\n\nUp to 80% of sufferers can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salts (WHO/ UNICEF ORS standard sachets). In adults, 2 to 4 litres of ORS may be required in the first 4 hours."}

The initial fluid deficit should be replaced within 3 to 4 hours of initial presentation. 10 to 20 mL/kg bodyweight should be calculated for each diarrhoeal stool or episode of vomiting.\n\nAntibiotic therapy in cholera is secondary; but in patients with severe disease, appropriate antibiotics diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excretion. In Bangladesh, resistance to furazolidone and tetracycline is increasing."}

After receiving 3 L in the first hour her pulse rate and blood pressure picked up to 84 bpm and 100/70 mmHg respectively. Over the next 3 hours she was given an additional 2L and became alert and responsive. She was then started on oral rehydration and given a single dose of 300 mg doxycycline. She was discharged on the third day, by which time stool consistency had returned to normal.\n\nThe local health authorities identified an additional 44 cases of cholera. All were treated, health education carried out and the overhead tanks were chlorinated.\n\nCholera, caused by V. cholerae, is a major cause of acute dehydrating diarrhoea, particularly in South and South-east Asia, where it is endemic; it also occurs as large-scale outbreaks in Africa and Latin America."}

Man is the only natural host of V. cholerae and asymptomatic carriage is possible. The main source of trans- mission is from a contaminated water source. In some parts of the world, copepods are responsible for maintaining Vibrio spp. in a viable but non-cultivable state.\n\nThe incubation period ranges between 12 hours and 5 days. Patients are usually afebrile and do not have any abdominal pain. The major clinical challenge is dehydration, ranging from mild to severe, and electrolyte imbalance leading on to renal failure in severe cases.\n\nIn epidemics, the diagnosis of cholera may be presumptive on clinical and epidemiological grounds following the WHO clinical case definition. Laboratory confirmation may be required when sporadic cases occur or when an extensive outbreak requires confirmation and typing of the etiological agent."}

In most cases oral replacement solutions may be used. Antimicrobial therapy is secondary; it is shown to decrease shedding of the bacteria and also hastens clinical resolution of illness. Tetracycline and doxycycline are the preferred drugs in adults, but ciprofloxacin or macrolides can also be used depending on availability and local resistance pattern.\n\nPublic health measures to improve water and sanitation are essential for long-term control.
