The patient was admitted immediately and started on intravenous rehydration with Ringer's lactate solution. After receiving 3 L in the first hour her pulse rate and blood pressure picked up to 84 bpm and 100/70 mmHg respectively. Over the next 3 hours she was given an additional 2L and became alert and responsive. She was then started on oral rehydration and given a single dose of 300 mg doxycycline. She was discharged on the third day, by which time stool consistency had returned to normal.

The local health authorities identified an additional 44 cases of cholera. All were treated, health education carried out and the overhead tanks were chlorinated.

Cholera, caused by V. cholerae, is a major cause of acute dehydrating diarrhoea, particularly in South and South-east Asia, where it is endemic; it also occurs as large-scale outbreaks in Africa and Latin America.
