A 22-year-old Bengali woman who has recently visited a religious festival is brought into hospital in a stuporous condition with a history of rapid onset of severe, acute watery diarrhoea. There is no fever, vomiting or abdominal pain. She is severely dehydrated and her electrolytes are deranged. The microscopic examination of her stool indicates cholera which is confirmed on culture. A number of other people who attended the same festival have also fallen ill with diarrhoea.

Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and urban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited, including refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as well as times of political and social unrest associated with a collapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera.
