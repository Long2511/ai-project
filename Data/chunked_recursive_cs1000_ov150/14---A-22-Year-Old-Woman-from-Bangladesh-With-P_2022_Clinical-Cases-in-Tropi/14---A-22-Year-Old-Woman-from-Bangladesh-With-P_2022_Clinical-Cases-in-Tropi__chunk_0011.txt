V. cholerae is an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus with typical darting motility. Man is the only natural host of V. cholerae and asymptomatic carriage is possible. The main source of trans- mission is from a contaminated water source. In some parts of the world, copepods are responsible for maintaining Vibrio spp. in a viable but non-cultivable state.

The incubation period ranges between 12 hours and 5 days. Patients are usually afebrile and do not have any abdominal pain. The major clinical challenge is dehydration, ranging from mild to severe, and electrolyte imbalance leading on to renal failure in severe cases.

In epidemics, the diagnosis of cholera may be presumptive on clinical and epidemiological grounds following the WHO clinical case definition. Laboratory confirmation may be required when sporadic cases occur or when an extensive outbreak requires confirmation and typing of the etiological agent.
