Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement are the cornerstones of cholera management and differ substantially from the approaches to patients with gastroenteritis of other aetiologies. Patients with severe cholera present with a higher degree of initial dehydration, have more rapid continuing losses and proportionately greater electrolyte depletion than patients with other forms of gastroenteritis. The most common error is for clinicians to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required for rehydration.

Up to 80% of sufferers can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salts (WHO/ UNICEF ORS standard sachets). In adults, 2 to 4 litres of ORS may be required in the first 4 hours.
