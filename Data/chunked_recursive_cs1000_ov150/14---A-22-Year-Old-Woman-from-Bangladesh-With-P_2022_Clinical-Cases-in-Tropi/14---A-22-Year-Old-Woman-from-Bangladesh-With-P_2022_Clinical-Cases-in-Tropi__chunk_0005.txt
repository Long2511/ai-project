The WHO has recommended an assessment based on the general clinical condition of the patient. The clinical assessment of dehydration in patients with suspected cholera is categorized into three levels. For no dehydration, meaning less than 5% fluid loss, the patient is well and alert, has normal eyes, drinks normally, has instantaneous skin turgor recoil, and a normal pulse. For some dehydration, representing 5-10% fluid loss, the patient is restless and irritable, has sunken eyes, is thirsty and drinks eagerly, has non-instantaneous skin turgor recoil, and a rapid, low-volume pulse. For severe dehydration, with over 10% fluid loss, the patient is lethargic or unconscious, has sunken eyes, drinks poorly or is unable to drink, has a very slow skin turgor recoil of over 2 seconds, and a weak or absent pulse. Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration
