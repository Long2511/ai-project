Laboratory results on admission showed the patient's sodium level was 143.8 mmol/L and the chloride level was 103.8 mmol/L, both within their respective reference ranges of 135-145 mmol/L and 98-108 mmol/L. However, several values were outside normal ranges: the potassium level was low at 3.0 mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and the bicarbonate level was also low at 11.4 mmol/L (reference range 23-28 mmol/L). Conversely, venous lactic acid was high at 4.1 mmol/L (reference range 0.67-1.8 mmol/L), as were creatinine at 203 µmol/L (reference range 62-115 µmol/L) and blood urea nitrogen at 8.6 mmol/L (reference range 2.9-7.1 mmol/L).

Macroscopic: Liquid stool, rice-water appearance with no faecal matter. Hanging drop preparation shows small slender curved bacilli with darting motility. Motility is completely inhibited by using Vibrio cholerae antiserum O1. Stool culture grows V. cholerae (Fig. 14.1) and the organism is typed as V. cholerae 01, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor.
