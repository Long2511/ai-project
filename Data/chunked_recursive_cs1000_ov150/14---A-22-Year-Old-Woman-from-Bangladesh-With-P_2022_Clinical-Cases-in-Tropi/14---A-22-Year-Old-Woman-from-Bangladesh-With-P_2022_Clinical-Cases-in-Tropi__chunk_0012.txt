Treatment typically involves isolation of the patient, correction of dehydration and antimicrobial treatment. In most cases oral replacement solutions may be used. Antimicrobial therapy is secondary; it is shown to decrease shedding of the bacteria and also hastens clinical resolution of illness. Tetracycline and doxycycline are the preferred drugs in adults, but ciprofloxacin or macrolides can also be used depending on availability and local resistance pattern.

Public health measures to improve water and sanitation are essential for long-term control. WHO has endorsed the inclusion of oral vaccines in cholera control programmes in endemic areas in conjunction with other preventive and control strategies.
