Patients with severe cholera typically require an average of 200 mL/kg of isotonic oral or IV fluids in the first 24 hours. The initial fluid deficit should be replaced within 3 to 4 hours of initial presentation. 10 to 20 mL/kg bodyweight should be calculated for each diarrhoeal stool or episode of vomiting.

Antibiotic therapy in cholera is secondary; but in patients with severe disease, appropriate antibiotics diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excretion. In Bangladesh, resistance to furazolidone and tetracycline is increasing.
