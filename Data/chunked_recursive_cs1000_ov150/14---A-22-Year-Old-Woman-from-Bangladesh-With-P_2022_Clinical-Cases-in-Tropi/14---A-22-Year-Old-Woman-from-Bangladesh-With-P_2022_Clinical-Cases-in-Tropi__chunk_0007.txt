. Fluids should be replaced over 3-4 hours, and the patient should be observed every 1-2 hours until all signs of dehydration resolve and they urinate. For patients with severe dehydration (more than 10% fluid loss), the requirement is over 100 mL/kg in the first 24 hours plus ongoing losses, administered intravenously. Rehydration should be done as rapidly as possible until circulation is restored, with the remainder of fluids given within 3 hours. Once circulation is established, the patient should be monitored every 1-2 hours.
