An outbreak is defined as the occurrence of disease episodes in greater numbers than would be expected at a particular time and place.

In this case there seems to be a typical cholera outbreak. The source is most probably contaminated water consumed from the containers during the festival, with the likelihood that unless control measures for disease prevention and appropriate case management are instituted rapidly, there will be spread, significant morbidity and, possibly, mortality.
