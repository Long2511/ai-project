. Depending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are assigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration or intravenous rehydration. The approach to rehydration depends on the degree of dehydration. For patients with no dehydration (less than 5% fluid loss), fluid replacement is needed only for ongoing losses, administered orally, and timed based on the patient's thirst. Monitoring involves observing the patient until ongoing losses can be adequately replaced by an oral rehydration solution (ORS). For patients with some dehydration (5-10% fluid loss), the requirement is 75 mL/kg in the first 24 hours in addition to ongoing losses, administered orally or intravenously. Fluids should be replaced over 3-4 hours, and the patient should be observed every 1-2 hours until all signs of dehydration resolve and they urinate
