Because the patient has lost her eyesight on the left side, the right eye should be carefully examined for possible growth of another OSSN that could be removed at an early stage. A fundoscopy should be performed in order to detect any abnormalities, especially an upcoming cytomegalovirus infection.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and counselled several times about the need for surgery. Yet she refused surgical intervention and was only willing to accept conservative treatment.

The patient's left orbit was covered with antibiotics and bandaged. When pain was sufficiently controlled, the patient was discharged with the offer to come back at any time.

She was asked to report to her antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic for control of the viral load and possible switch of her antiretroviral therapy.
