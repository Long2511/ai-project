The lesion most likely is an advanced ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). OSSN are commonly seen in HIV-positive individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. They start as discrete whitish conjunctival lesions (Fig. 43.2) and may develop into large tumours if left untreated. Early stages may be confused with pterygium, with an amelanotic naevus, or a lipoma. Malignant lesions such as amelanotic melanomas, lymphomas or adenocarcinomas may look similar as well.

The patient should be started on analgesic treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. She should be counselled and booked for surgery. An extended exenteration of the left eyeball and orbit should be done. Control of the patient's HIV infection is crucial, and her HIV viral load should be checked.
