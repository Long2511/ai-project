A 35-year-old woman from Malawi presents to the outpatient department of a local tertiary hospital. She was referred by an ophthalmic clinical officer from a district hospital for exenteration of the left eye because of an ocular tumour.

The first symptoms started 8 months prior when she noticed a whitish lesion growing on the conjunctiva of her left eye. She presented at a health centre and was prescribed non- specified eye drops. Yet, over the following months the lesion grew bigger and turned reddish. She went to a traditional healer who prescribed herbal eye drops, which did not help either. The lesion grew constantly bigger and she finally lost her eyesight in the affected eye. Pain also increased which made her present at her local district hospital.

The patient is known to be HIV-positive. She has been on antiretroviral treatment for the past 3 years. The CD4 count is unknown.
