Early, non-invasive stages of OSSN can be treated with topical chemotherapeutic agents such as topical 5-flurouracil and mitomycin or subconjunctival interferon-x2b. Primary treatment is surgical excision. Inexpensive use of fluorouracil 1% eyedrops for 4 weeks substantially reduces the risk of recurrence. It is a lowcost option listed on the WHO's Essential Drug List. In more advanced disease, surgery may have to involve enucleation of the eye or exenteration of the orbit. Adjuvant treatment can decrease recurrence rate, which after simple excision is high (30%-40%). Possibilities for adjunctive treatment include topical chemotherapy, cryotherapy and intraoperative β-irradiation. Diagnosis of OSSN in an HIV-unknown individual should prompt the clinician to perform an HIV test. Because HIV seems to play a role in tumour development, HIV-reactive patients with OSSN should receive effective ART to achieve virological control.
