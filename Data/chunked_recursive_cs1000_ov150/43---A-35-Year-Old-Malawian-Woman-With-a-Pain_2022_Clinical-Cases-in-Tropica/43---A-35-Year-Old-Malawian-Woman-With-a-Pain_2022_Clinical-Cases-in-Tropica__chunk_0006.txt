The term OSSN is used to describe dysplastic lesions of conjunctiva and cornea ranging from conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva (SCCC). The use of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in OSSN may help detect intraocular invasion. Prominent nodular tumours >5 mm thick can also be taken as risk factors for intraocular involvement. HIV infection, ultraviolet radiation (UV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) are strongly associated with OSSN. These factors, together with vitamin A deficiency, weaken the tumour surveillance system and allow DNA-damaged cells to proliferate into tumours. A five- to tenfold increase in incidence has been observed in parallel with the HIV epidemic. The current incidence of OSSN in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 2.2 per 100 000, and it continues to rise (USA: 0.3 per 100 000). By which mechanism HIV infection favours development of OSSN is as yet unknown
