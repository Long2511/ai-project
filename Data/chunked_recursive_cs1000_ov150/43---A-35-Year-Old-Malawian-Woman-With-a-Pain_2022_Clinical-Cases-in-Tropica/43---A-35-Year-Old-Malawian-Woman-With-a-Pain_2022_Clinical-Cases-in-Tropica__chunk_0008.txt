OSSN typically presents as a greyish, elevated, gelatinous mass surrounded by engorged conjunctival vessels. There is no explanation why the disease is mostly unilateral. It often starts to develop at the nasal side of the eye and spreads to involve the whole conjunctiva, lids, local tissue and lymph nodes. In the developing world, patients often present late with sometimes disfiguring lesions. There is a trend towards treating conjunctival lesions suspected to be OSSN based on clinical impression. However, clinical diagnosis by slit lamp - with or without gonio-scopy - is difficult because of the overlap in clinical features of OSSN and non-OSSN lesions. Toluidine blue 0.05% vital staining is a good screening tool. Negative staining results indicate that OSSN is relatively unlikely. It does, however, not replace surgical biopsy with histopathological examination.
