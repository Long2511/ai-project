A 25-year-old Malawian woman, known to be HIV-positive and on ART, presents with acute severe symptoms including a high fever, a rapid decline in consciousness and new onset convulsions, suggesting a severe neurological infection. Her CSF is hazy and shows a neutrophilic pleocytosis, as well as a high CSF-protein and low glucose.

Bacterial meningitis is the most likely diagnosis; tuberculous meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis are possibilities, though much less likely, since they tend to present in a sub-acute manner.
