She is not pregnant, therefore meningitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes is very unlikely. Bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis in HIV-infected adults include S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, invasive non-typhoidal salmonellae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae; all will be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin. European guidelines recommend 14 days of antibiotics in HIV-infected adults with bacterial meningitis. However, in sub-Saharan Africa often shorter courses are given, determined by the patient's recovery rate, local guidelines and availability of antibiotics for long courses. In children with bacterial meningitis in Malawi, 5 days of ceftriaxone was shown to be non-inferior to ten days, with substantial savings shown, and shorter courses are now commonly used.
