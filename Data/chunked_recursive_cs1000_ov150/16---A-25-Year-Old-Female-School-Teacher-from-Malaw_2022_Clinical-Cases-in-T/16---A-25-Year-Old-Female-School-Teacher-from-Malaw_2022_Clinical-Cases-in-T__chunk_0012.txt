Adjunctive treatments have failed to reduce lethality in large randomized controlled trials in Africa despite efficacy elsewhere. In well-resourced settings, important risk factors for poor outcome include advanced age, hyperglycaemia and immunosuppression. In Africa, coma, seizures, anaemia and delayed presentation to hospital are poor prognostic features. Antibiotic treatment depends on local sensitivities. A third-generation cephalosporin at high dose given as early as possible is the treatment of choice.
