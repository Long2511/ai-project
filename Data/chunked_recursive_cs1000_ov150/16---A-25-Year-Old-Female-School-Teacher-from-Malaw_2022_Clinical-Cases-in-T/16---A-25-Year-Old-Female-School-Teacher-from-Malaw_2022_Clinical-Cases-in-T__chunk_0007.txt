In cases of suspected meningitis, a lumbar puncture (LP) must be undertaken to obtain a diagnosis. Despite clinical contraindications to lumbar puncture in this patient (seizures and altered conscious level), the risk of causing harm by doing an LP is low. LP should not be delayed by attempts to obtain cerebral imaging unless obvious signs of a space-occupying lesion are present. CT scan of the brain is of limited value in bacterial meningitis. Administration of antibiotics should not be delayed while the LP is undertaken, particularly in resource-limited settings.
