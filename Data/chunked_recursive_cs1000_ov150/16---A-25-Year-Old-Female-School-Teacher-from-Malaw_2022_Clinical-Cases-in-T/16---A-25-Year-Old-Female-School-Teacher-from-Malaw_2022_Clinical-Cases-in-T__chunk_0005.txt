The immediate treatment priority is emergency resuscitation, including rapid administration of antibiotics. A third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone at a high dose to penetrate the CSF is appropriate; where this is not available, high dose benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol is a suitable alternative. Resistance rates of S. pneumoniae to both penicillins and chloramphenicol are rising, hence local advice about resistance patterns should be sought. Data to guide resuscitation in adults are limited, but airway support and seizure control are indicated. Public health services are required for case management to ensure that appropriate vaccination programmes and case notification for outbreak monitoring are done.
