Several meta-analyses suggest that while in well-resourced countries dexamethasone should be given to adults and children presenting to hospital with meningitis, steroids should not be used in resource-limited hospitals in Africa given their lack of efficacy. Glycerol has been tested in paediatric meningitis with mixed results but was shown to be harmful in adults with meningitis in Malawi. No other adjuncts have been tested in clinical trials to date; adjunctive treatment is not indicated.
