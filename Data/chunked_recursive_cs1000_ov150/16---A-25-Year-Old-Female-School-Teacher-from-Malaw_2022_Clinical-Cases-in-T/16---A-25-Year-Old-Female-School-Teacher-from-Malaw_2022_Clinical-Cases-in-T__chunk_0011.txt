In resource-rich settings, acute bacterial meningitis in adults and children is declining in incidence because of successful vaccination campaigns, but sporadic cases continue to occur. In contrast, many countries with high HIV prevalence have reported an increase in patients presenting with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) since the start of the HIV epidemic.
Case fatality rates in resource-rich settings have declined from 45–50% to 11–25% over the past 50 years, associated with early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and better supportive care. In contrast, adult ABM lethality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are reported to vary between 50 and 70% without any change over time, and survivors experience higher rates of neurological disabilities.
