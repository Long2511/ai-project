In Vietnam, however, the commonest identified cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus suis. Like its counterparts, S. suis infection can cause both meningitis and septic shock; the syndromes overlap. A florid purpuric rash is common (6%–31% of patient cases).
Other forms of meningitis seen in Asia and the tropics include tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. Although each of these tends to have a more insidious onset, the duration of symptoms before presentation can be as short as 4 to 5 days; these diagnoses therefore should always be considered. However, they are not associated with shock or purpuric rash.
