S. suis is the most frequently confirmed cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Globally, it is an economically important zoonotic pathogen of pigs causing septicaemia, joint and genitourinary tract infections. Human disease is almost exclusively caused by serotype 2. It is reported globally but seems particularly frequent in East and South-east Asia.
Outbreaks of severe sepsis have been reported from China. The prevalence of disease in Asia is probably driven by farming and food practices; disease is more common in those in contact with pigs and raw pork. Infection is rare in children because culturally they are protected from contact with pigs. Antibiotic resistance is rarely reported in human isolates. First-line treatment is ceftriaxone; adjunctive treatment with steroids reduces the risk for deafness in adults, which occurs in up to 70%.
