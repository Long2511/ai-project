Meningitis is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment. Lumbar puncture is the investigation of choice but should not delay administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A typical choice is ceftriaxone; where resistance is suspected or common epidemiologically, vancomycin is also administered. The value of adjunctive corticosteroids in acute bacterial meningitis is difficult to generalize. Large studies in Africa found no benefit; this contrasts with Western Europe, where steroids reduced the risk of death, and Vietnam, where in microbiologically confirmed disease they reduced the risk of complications.
