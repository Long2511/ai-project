The patient requires a lumbar puncture and blood cultures. CSF should be sent for microscopy, Gram stain, cell count, protein, glucose and culture. A simultaneous blood glucose measurement should be performed. If resources are limited, then CSF glucose with simultaneous blood glucose is the most important test informing clinical management, because a normal ratio (i.e. a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.6) excludes acute bacterial meningitis and TB. In both bacterial and TB meningitis, the CSF/serum glucose ratio is expected to be markedly diminished. Rapid diagnostic tests such as pneumococcal antigen can be performed on CSF, blood or urine, and meningococcal polymerase chain reaction on blood or CSF if available. Because the patient is from a malaria-endemic area, the blood film should be repeated.
