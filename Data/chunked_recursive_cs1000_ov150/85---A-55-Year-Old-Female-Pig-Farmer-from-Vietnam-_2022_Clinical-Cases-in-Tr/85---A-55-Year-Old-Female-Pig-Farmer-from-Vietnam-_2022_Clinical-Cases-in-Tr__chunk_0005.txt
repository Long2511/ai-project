The patient presented at the rural district hospital with fever and malaise and developed confusion. There is malaria in rural Vietnam and both P. falciparum and P. vivax are endemic; therefore severe malaria must be excluded. Enteric fever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries, can cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of disease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue fever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be considered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with transient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse erythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small proportion of patients develop severe disease during a second, immune-mediated phase (usually on day 4–6). This phase may be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous bleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as encephalitis.
In this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningitis and shock is not typical for dengue.
