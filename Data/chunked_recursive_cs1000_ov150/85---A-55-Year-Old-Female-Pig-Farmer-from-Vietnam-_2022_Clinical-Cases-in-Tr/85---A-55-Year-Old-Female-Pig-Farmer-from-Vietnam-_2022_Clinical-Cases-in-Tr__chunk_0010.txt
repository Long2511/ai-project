The patient received empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin, and supportive treatment including intravenous fluids. Lumbar puncture revealed turbid cerebrospinal fluid with 2870 cells/µL (<5), 92% neutrophils, protein 541.16 mg/dL (15–45) and CSF glucose 2.44 mmol/l (2.5–4.4). Blood glucose was 19 mmol/L (3.9–6.1), CSF/serum glucose ratio 0.12 (normal 0.6).
Gram stain showed a Gram-positive coccus in short chains, and negative India ink, mycobacterial GeneXpert and Herpes simplex virus PCR. Repeat malaria film and malaria rapid diagnostic tests were negative. Five days later, both blood and CSF cultures grew S. suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone.
The patient received 12 days of antibiotic therapy. Dexamethasone was administered for the first 4 days of treatment. She responded to treatment but had residual bilateral hearing impairment.
