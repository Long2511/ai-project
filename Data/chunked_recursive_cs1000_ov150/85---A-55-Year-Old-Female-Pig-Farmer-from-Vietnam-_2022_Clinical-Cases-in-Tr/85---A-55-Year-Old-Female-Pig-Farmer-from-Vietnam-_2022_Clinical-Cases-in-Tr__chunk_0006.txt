In this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningitis and shock is not typical for dengue.
Melioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider. In some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause of community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a risk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain abscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is comparatively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease remains to be elucidated.
The most likely diagnosis though seems to be acute bacterial meningitis complicated by septic shock. Globally, the common causes of acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis infections can be complicated by development of a purpuric rash; this is more common with N. meningitidis septicemia.
