Serology is highly sensitive but may lack specificity in individuals from endemic countries. Although aspiration of a suspected ALA is not a routine investigation, aspirated fluid can be tested with multiplex PCR testing for the rapid and robust diagnosis of amoebiasis in patients with cystic focal liver lesions. The aspirated fluid is thick, odourless and brownish in colour; it is bacteriologically sterile and amoebic trophozoites are not usually detectable in the aspirate. The term 'abscess' is a misnomer, as the 'pus' is in fact necrotic liver.

Most patients rapidly respond to antibiotic treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole.

Metronidazole 500 to 750 mg tds PO or IV should be given for 7 to 10 days, tinidazole 2 g per day PO for 3 to 5 days. This should be followed by a luminal amoebicide, such as paromomycin, diloxanide furoate, or iodoquinol.
