The role of therapeutic percutaneous aspiration or drainage is still controversial. It may be useful in large abscesses, especially when located in the left liver lobe with high risk for rupturing into the pericardium, and in ALA that do not respond to nitroimidazole therapy within 72 hours when pyogenic infection is a concern. Lesions may take a long time to decrease in size, therefore short-term, follow-up imaging has to be interpreted with caution.
