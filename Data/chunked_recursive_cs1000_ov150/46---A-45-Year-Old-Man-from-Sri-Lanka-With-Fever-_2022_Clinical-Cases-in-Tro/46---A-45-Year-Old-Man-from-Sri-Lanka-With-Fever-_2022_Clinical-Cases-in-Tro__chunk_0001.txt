A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man presents to a local hospital with fever, chills, headache, body aches and severe right hypochondrial pain for the past week. He has also developed a dry cough during the past few days. He has vomited twice during his illness and has lost his appetite.

His abdominal pain is constant and dull. It radiates to the right shoulder and is made worse when coughing and resting on the right side.

The patient had been well before the current illness. He admits to consuming locally brewed alcohol (‘toddy', made of coconut flowers) daily for the past 10 to 15 years.
