Because of its large size, the lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance, yielding brownish pus highly suspicious of an amoebic liver abscess.

For the treatment of amoebic liver abscesses, tissue agents include Metronidazole, given at a dose of 500-750 mg intravenously or orally three times a day for 7-10 days. Alternatively, Tinidazole can be used at 2 g orally once a day for 3-5 days, Ornidazole at 0.5 g intravenously twice a day for 3-6 days, or Nitazoxanide at 500 mg orally twice a day for 3 days. Following this, luminal agents are used. Options include Paromomycin at a dose of 8-10 mg/kg orally three times a day for 7 days, Diloxanide Furoate at 500 mg orally three times a day for 10 days, or Iodoquinole at 650 mg orally three times a day after meals for 20 days.

The patient was treated with metronidazole for ten days and made a rapid and uneventful recovery.
