Another tropical infectious disease to consider in a febrile patient from Asia with any kind of organ abscess is melioidosis. Melioidosis, caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, can also present with pulmonary infiltrates and cavities similar to TB, as septic arthritis, with skin manifestations and with cerebral involvement. Cases of melioidosis have been increasingly reported from Sri Lanka. The majority of cases occur in the immunocompromised, especially with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but also alcoholism, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, steroid use, immunosuppressive therapy and cancer.

Melioidosis is also endemic in other parts of Asia, such as India, Thailand, Lao PR, Vietnam and in northern Australia, sporadic cases are seen all over the tropics.
