Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extraintestinal form of invasive amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The infection occurs worldwide but is most common in tropical areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation. Rates of ALA are 3 to 20 times higher in men between 18 and 50 years of age than in other populations; the reasons for this are poorly understood but hormonal factors are being discussed, as well as alcohol consumption. Humans acquire the infection by ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water. Trophozoites of E. histolytica may penetrate the intestinal wall and haematogenously spread to the liver. Clinical manifestations include fever with chills, right hypochondrial pain, anorexia and weight loss, but most patients with ALA do not have a history of recent dysentery. A dry cough and fine crepitations over the right lung bases are common. Jaundice is unusual. Localized intercostal tenderness helps in the clinical diagnosis
