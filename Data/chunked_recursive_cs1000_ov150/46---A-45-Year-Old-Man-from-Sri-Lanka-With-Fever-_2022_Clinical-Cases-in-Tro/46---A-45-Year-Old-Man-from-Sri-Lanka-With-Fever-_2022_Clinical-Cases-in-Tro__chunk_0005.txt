The most likely diagnosis in this man is a liver abscess, which could be amoebic or pyogenic. Given the Asian setting, hyermucoviscous serotypes of Klebisella pneumoniae have to be considered which have been increasingly detected in South and South East Asia since around 1990 and also seem to be spreading to countries outside Asia. Given the epidemiological setting, the relatively young age of the patient and the absence of comorbidities such as diabetes or biliary disease, an amoebic liver abscess is more likely. Also, the alcoholic drink the patient consumes is locally known to be linked with amoebiasis. The precise mechanisms are still under discussion; it is assumed that the parasites contaminate the clay containers used to collect toddy, but additional factors may play a role as well.
