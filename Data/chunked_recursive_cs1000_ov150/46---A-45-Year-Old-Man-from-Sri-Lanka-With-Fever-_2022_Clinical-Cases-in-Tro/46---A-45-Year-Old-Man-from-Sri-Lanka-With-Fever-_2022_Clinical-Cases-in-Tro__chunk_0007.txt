An ultrasound of the liver should be done. Entamoeba histolytica serology is highly sensitive and useful as a screening test; however, it may lack specificity in individuals from highly endemic tropical regions like the Indian subcontinent. Recently, multiplex PCR testing on aspirated fluid has been identified as a rapid and robust diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess in patients with cystic focal liver lesions. Stool microscopy for E. histolytica trophozoites may be attempted but is less than 50% sensitive.

The ultrasound scan of his abdomen revealed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall measuring 7×6cm in the right liver lobe. There was a small pleural effusion on the right.

Because of its large size, the lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance, yielding brownish pus highly suspicious of an amoebic liver abscess.
