Leukocytosis, raised inflammatory parameters and an elevated alkaline phosphatase are the most common non-specific laboratory findings. Diagnosis is usually made by a combination of imaging studies and serology. Abdominal ultrasound scan is the most suitable imaging technique in resource-limited settings, but CT and MRI scans are also highly sensitive. None of the imaging techniques is specific for ALA. Plain radiography of the thorax may reveal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
