A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man presents with fever, headache, body aches and constant right-sided abdominal pain for a week. He also has a dry cough. His past medical history is unremarkable, but he consumes local alcohol. He is febrile with tender hepatomegaly and intercostal tenderness on the right. There is no jaundice.

His blood results show very mildly elevated transaminases, an elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) and raised inflammatory markers.

Tender hepatomegaly, intercostal tenderness and an elevated right hemidiaphragm in the context of fever point towards an infectious focus in the liver.

His transaminases are only slightly elevated; AST is higher than ALT, which could be explained merely by his regular alcohol consumption. In infectious hepatitis one would expect higher transaminase levels and clinical jaundice.
