His haemoglobin was 12.3 g/dL and platelet count was 224 x 10⁹/L, both within normal reference ranges. Liver function tests revealed elevated levels of AST at 54 U/L, ALT at 38 U/L, and ALP at 446 U/L, all above their respective reference ranges. His total serum bilirubin was normal at 10.3 µmol/L, while direct serum bilirubin was low at 1.5 µmol/L. Renal function markers showed elevated blood urea nitrogen at 7 mmol/L and serum creatinine at 124 µmol/L. The C-reactive protein level was significantly elevated at 48 mg/L, whereas the reference is less than 6.
