The spread of Ebola virus between humans is through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. Secondary attack rates are generally 15% to 20% during outbreaks in Africa, and much lower if proper universal precautions are maintained. Specialized viral HF precautions and personal protective equipment are warranted when there is a confirmed case or high index of suspicion, such as in this case.
