Because symptoms are generally non-specific and laboratory testing is not widely available, viral HF outbreaks are usually recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs, especially when healthcare workers are involved. Having been into caves or mines, and direct or indirect contact with wild animals or people with suspected viral HF, are key diagnostic clues, but these are not uniformly present. Outside consultation with experts in the field and testing of suspected cases should be rapidly undertaken and public health authorities must be alerted.

Contact tracing should be undertaken to identify all persons with direct unprotected exposure with the case patient, with surveillance of contacts for fever for 21 days (the maximum incubation period for Ebola and Marburg virus diseases). Any contact developing fever or showing other signs of viral HF should immediately be isolated and tested.
