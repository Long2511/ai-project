Treatment is supportive. Antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed. Preliminary results from a clinical trial of experimental compounds conducted during an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo show very promising results, reducing case fatality to as low as 10% if treatment is administered early in the course of disease. Similarly, a clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and during the massive 2013 to 2016 outbreak in West Africa showed protective efficacy of over 90%.
