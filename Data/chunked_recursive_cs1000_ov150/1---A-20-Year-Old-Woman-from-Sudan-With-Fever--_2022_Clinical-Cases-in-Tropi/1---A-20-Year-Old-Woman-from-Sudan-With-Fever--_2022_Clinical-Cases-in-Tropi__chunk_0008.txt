Ebola and Marburg virus diseases are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with Ebola virus typically found in tropical rainforests in the central and western parts of the continent and Marburg virus in the drier forest or savannah in the east. Evidence strongly implicates fruit bats as the filovirus reservoir, especially the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) as the reservoir for Marburg virus. Human infection likely occurs from inadvertent exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva. Male-to-female sexual transmission may occur months after infection because of the virus's persistence in the semen, although these events are relatively rare.
