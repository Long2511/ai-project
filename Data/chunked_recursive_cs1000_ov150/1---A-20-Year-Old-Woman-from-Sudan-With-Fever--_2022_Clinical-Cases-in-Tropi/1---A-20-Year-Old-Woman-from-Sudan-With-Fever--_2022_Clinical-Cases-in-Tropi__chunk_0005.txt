Intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and analgesics were begun on admission. Nevertheless, the patient's condition rapidly worsened, with subconjunctival haemorrhage, copious bleeding from the mouth, nose and rectum (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2), dyspnoea and hypothermic shock (temperature 36.0°C, blood pressure unreadable, pulse 150 bpm, respiratory rate 36 cycles per minute). She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission. Laboratory testing at a specialized laboratory established as part of the outbreak response showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for ELISA IgG antibody, confirming the diagnosis of Ebola virus disease.
