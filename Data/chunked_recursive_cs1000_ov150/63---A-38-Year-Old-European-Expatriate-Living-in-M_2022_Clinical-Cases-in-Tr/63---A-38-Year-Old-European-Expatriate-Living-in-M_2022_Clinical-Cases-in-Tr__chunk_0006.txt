An MRI scan of the spinal cord was performed. An enhancing 1 cm large lesion was seen at the anterior aspect of the conus, with associated high T2 signal representing oedema extending from the lower end of the conus to the level of T9. In addition, there was nodular thickening of the urine bladder wall at the base and the posterior aspect.
