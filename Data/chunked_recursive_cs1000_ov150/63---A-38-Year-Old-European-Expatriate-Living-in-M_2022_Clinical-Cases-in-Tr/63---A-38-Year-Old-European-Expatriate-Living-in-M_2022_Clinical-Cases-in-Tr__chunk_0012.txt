Other causes of myelitis should be ruled out, which is often impossible in low-resource settings where pragmatic treatment for suspected neuroschistosomiasis may be justified.

Treatment of neuroschistosomiasis is with antischistosomal drugs (praziquantel) plus corticosteroids and is based on case series and expert opinion. The pathology is caused by inflammation around Schistosoma eggs. Praziquantel kills adult flukes only and thereby stops additional eggs being shed into the spinal cord. Most early improvement of the neurological presentation is thought to result from the antiinflammatory effects of corticosteroids. The optimal dose and duration are not well known. Up to 6 months of high-dose corticosteroids is recommended; however, data from randomized controlled trials are lacking.

Laminectomy should be considered in patients with severe spinal cord compression.
