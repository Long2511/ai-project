The most important differential diagnosis for a conus medullaris syndrome in a young, otherwise healthy man living in tropical Africa is spinal cord schistosomiasis. Other important infections to consider are spinal tuberculosis, a spinal abscess and neurosyphilis. A tumour or metastases impinging on the conus medullaris should be ruled out.

Urine and stool microscopy for ova of Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni, respectively, should be ordered. A full blood count should be done, including a white cell differential count to look for eosinophilia. Creatinine and C-reactive protein should be tested.

Schistosomiasis serology would be useful in this expatriate.

A VDRL and an HIV test should be done. An ultrasound of the abdomen assessing bladder volume before and after micturition and imaging of the spinal cord should be requested.
