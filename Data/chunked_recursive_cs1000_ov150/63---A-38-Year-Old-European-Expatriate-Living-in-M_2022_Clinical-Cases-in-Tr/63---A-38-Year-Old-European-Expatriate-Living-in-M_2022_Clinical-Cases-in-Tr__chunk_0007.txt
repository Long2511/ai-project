The diagnosis of an infection with Schistosoma haematobium was made as evidenced by the urine findings and supported by the eosinophilia and the abnormalities seen in the bladder wall on MRI scanning. This was complicated by spinal cord schistosomiasis (see Summary Box) with lesions in the conus medullaris, causing a conus syndrome. A dual infection with S. haematobium and S. mansoni is possible, because S. mansoni is the more common pathogen causing spinal cord schistosomiasis, and both pathogens are endemic in Malawi. Theoretically, the spinal cord abnormalities could have been caused by other conditions, such as tuberculosis and metastatic cancer, for instance from a bladder carcinoma. Although it has been argued that S. haematobium infection is a risk factor for bladder carcinoma, this is mainly observed in long-term heavy infections, which are uncommon in expatriates
