The patient was able to retrieve details of his urine microscopy from the local clinic. Schistosoma haematobium eggs had been identified in his urine and he had been treated with a full dose of praziquantel, a course of ciprofloxacin, buscopan and bisacodyl.

He had swum regularly in Lake Malawi.

An abdominal ultrasound scan after attempted micturition showed a large bladder residue without further abnormalities.

Full blood count showed a normal absolute WBC of 9 × 109/L with a relative eosinophilia of 21.8% (reference range: 1–6%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 1.15 × 109/L (reference: <0.45 × 10⁹/L). ALT was slightly elevated. Creatinine and CRP were normal.

An HIV test and the VDRL were negative and microscopy of a stool and urine sample were normal. Serological tests for schistosomiasis were not available.
