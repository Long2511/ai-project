A 38-year-old European expatriate presents at the medical outpatient clinic in a tertiary hospital in Malawi with progressive constipation and difficulty passing urine for the past 3 weeks. He noticed that he had to use increasing abdominal pressure to pass urine and eventually became only able to pass small amounts at a time. This is associated with increasing lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and around the genitals and some erectile dysfunction. He has no weakness and there is no dysaesthesia and no loss of sensation in his legs. However, he mentions that walking did not feel normal, although he cannot fully explain what the abnormality is. He has no backache.

Over the past 2 months he has experienced unintentional weight loss of 8 kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. He blames this on stressful circumstances at work. He has sexual contact with his wife only, to whom he has been married for several years.
