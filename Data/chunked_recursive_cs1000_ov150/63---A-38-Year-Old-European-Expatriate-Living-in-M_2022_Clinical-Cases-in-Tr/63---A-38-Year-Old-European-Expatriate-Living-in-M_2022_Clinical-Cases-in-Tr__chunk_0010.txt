Our understanding of the pathophysiology of neuroschistosomiasis is limited. For unknown reasons, ectopic worms lodge in the venous plexus around the CNS instead of their normal habitat. Laminectomy with biopsy of the nervous tissue is the only method that gives a definite diagnosis of SCS. However, this procedure should be avoided because of its risks. Diagnosis is based upon spinal cord imaging and proof of exposure to the parasite. Urine should be examined for S. haematobium eggs; for S. mansoni, stool microscopy may be attempted but lacks sensitivity, which is much higher for rectal biopsies. The circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test is a urine antigen test, which may prove S. mansoni infection. It detects an antigen regurgitated by adult worms of S. mansoni. It is less sensitive for S. haematobium and generally works better if the parasite burden is high
