Neuroschistosomiasis can occur in the brain and more frequently in the spinal cord. Cerebral schistosomiasis can be asymptomatic or present with seizures, lateralizing signs and meningo-encephalitis. Spinal cord schistosomiasis (SCS) is more frequent in S. mansoni than in S. haematobium infections and often causes severe disability because of paraparesis and bladder dysfunction. It is also the most important severe complication of schistosomiasis in travellers.
