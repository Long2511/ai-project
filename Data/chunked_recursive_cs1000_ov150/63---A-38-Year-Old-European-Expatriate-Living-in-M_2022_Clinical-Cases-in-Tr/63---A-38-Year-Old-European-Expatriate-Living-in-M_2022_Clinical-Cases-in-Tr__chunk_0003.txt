A 38-year-old European expatriate living in Malawi presents with constipation, bladder retention, an episode of probable haematuria, erectile dysfunction, genital paraesthesia, significant weight loss and fatigue. There are no abnormal neurological findings on examination, however most of the complaints are compatible with a conus syndrome because of a lesion within the conus medullaris or because of compression. The constitutional symptoms suggest an underlying chronic infection or malignancy.

The important missing pieces of information are details of the recent visit to the local clinic and exposure to fresh water in Malawi. On physical examination, the anal reflex should have been tested.
