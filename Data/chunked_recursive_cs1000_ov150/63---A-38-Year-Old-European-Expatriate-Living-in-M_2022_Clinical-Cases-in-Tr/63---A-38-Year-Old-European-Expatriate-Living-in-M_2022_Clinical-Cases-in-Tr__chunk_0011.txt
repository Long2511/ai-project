. mansoni. It is less sensitive for S. haematobium and generally works better if the parasite burden is high. A novel test for the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) is under development and seems to be more promising for proof of both parasite species in urine and blood. Serological tests are useful in patients from non-endemic countries. They lack sensitivity and specificity in endemic populations. Detection of schistosomal antibodies in the CSF is specific but not widely validated. Eosinophils are present in the CSF in about 50% of patients.
