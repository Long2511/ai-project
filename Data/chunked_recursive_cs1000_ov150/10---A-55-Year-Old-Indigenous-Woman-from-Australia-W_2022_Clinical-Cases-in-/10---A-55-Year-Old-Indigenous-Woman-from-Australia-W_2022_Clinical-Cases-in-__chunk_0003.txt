A 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman has a widespread exfoliating rash and is clearly systemically unwell with signs of sepsis.

The exfoliating rash is classical for crusted scabies, which is uncommon but well recognized in remote indigenous communities where scabies remains endemic. Undiagnosed cases can be 'core transmitters' of scabies; and in this case many household members, and in particular the children, had multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. In addition, this woman has secondary sepsis which is likely to be from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia, with inoculation through her skin fissures. However, Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis is also occasionally seen in patients with crusted scabies.
