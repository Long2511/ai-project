Treatment consisted of a five-dose course of ivermectin (200 µg/kg/dose) on days 0, 1, 7, 8 and 14, together with a topical scabicide (benzyl benzoate 25%) applied every second day for the first week; then twice weekly for the second week, with a keratolytic cream (lactic acid and urea in sorbolene cream) after bathing on the days the topical scabicide was not administered. Her blood cultures taken in the community grew S. aureus resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin, but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (i.e. community-acquired MRSA). She was therefore given 2 weeks of IV vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures 48 hours after admission were negative, and by that stage she was afebrile, off oxygen and eating well
