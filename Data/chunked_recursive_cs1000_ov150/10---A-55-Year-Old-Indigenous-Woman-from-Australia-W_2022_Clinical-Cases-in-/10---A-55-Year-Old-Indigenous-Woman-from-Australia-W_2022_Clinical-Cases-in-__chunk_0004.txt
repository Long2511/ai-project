She is transported to the community health centre where you put her on oxygen, insert a wide-bore cannula, take an additional set of blood cultures, give her 1 litre of normal saline over 30 minutes and commence her on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 2g and gentamicin 320 mg (her weight is 62kg).

After the IV fluids, her blood pressure rose to 95 mmHg systolic and her oxygen saturation was 97% with oxygen by nasal prongs. She was evacuated to the regional hospital. In the clinic, microscopy of her skin scrapings under low-power magnification confirmed the diagnosis, showing multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. In the hospital, the patient was managed in a single room with enhanced contact precautions to prevent transmission of scabies to staff and visitors.
