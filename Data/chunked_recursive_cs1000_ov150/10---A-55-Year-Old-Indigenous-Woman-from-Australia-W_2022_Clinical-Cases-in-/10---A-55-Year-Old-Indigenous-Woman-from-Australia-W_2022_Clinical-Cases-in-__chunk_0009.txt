Crusted scabies results from unfettered mite reproduction and host reaction, resulting in formation of hyperkeratotic skin crusts that may be loose and flaky or thick and adherent. Skin flakes with thousands of mites can be shed onto bed linen and floors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the distribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp as well as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and elbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath the nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can be limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary scabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is variable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial infection are common. A peripheral blood eosinophilia is common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often extremely high
