You are working in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, and the community health worker asks you to visit a house to assess an elderly woman who has been living in the crowded back room. Her family are worried that she has become increasingly withdrawn and hasn't been getting out of the house much at all.

The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs and especially the armpits, buttocks and thighs. Many flakes of skin cover the mattress she is lying on. In addition, she has fissures over her wrists and knees. She also looks pale, is clammy and poorly responsive. Her temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate 110bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure 85 mmHg systolic to radial pulsation. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is 92% on room air.
