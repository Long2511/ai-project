Her family are worried that she has become increasingly withdrawn and hasn't been getting out of the house much at all.\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs and especially the armpits, buttocks and thighs. Many flakes of skin cover the mattress she is lying on. In addition, she has fissures over her wrists and knees. She also looks pale, is clammy and poorly responsive. Her temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate 110bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure 85 mmHg systolic to radial pulsation. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is 92% on room air."}

Undiagnosed cases can be 'core transmitters' of scabies; and in this case many household members, and in particular the children, had multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. In addition, this woman has secondary sepsis which is likely to be from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia, with inoculation through her skin fissures. However, Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis is also occasionally seen in patients with crusted scabies."}

She was evacuated to the regional hospital. In the clinic, microscopy of her skin scrapings under low-power magnification confirmed the diagnosis, showing multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. In the hospital, the patient was managed in a single room with enhanced contact precautions to prevent transmission of scabies to staff and visitors."}

Her blood cultures taken in the community grew S. aureus resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin, but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (i.e. community-acquired MRSA). She was therefore given 2 weeks of IV vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures 48 hours after admission were negative, and by that stage she was afebrile, off oxygen and eating well"}

Crusted or Norwegian scabies was first described in patients with leprosy in Norway. Crusted scabies can occur after immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation, rheumatological conditions, chemotherapy for malignancy and in infection with HIV and HTLV-1. It can also occur in malnutrition, Down's syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized, especially those with physical or cognitive disability who are unable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many thousands of mites in skin lesions and can serve as 'core transmitters' for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities and nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are not genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those infected from these cases."}

Skin flakes with thousands of mites can be shed onto bed linen and floors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the distribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp as well as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and elbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath the nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can be limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary scabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is variable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial infection are common. A peripheral blood eosinophilia is common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often extremely high"}
