Although Sarcoptes scabiei infection and mite reproduction is usually self-limiting, hyperinfestation can develop in susceptible individuals. Crusted or Norwegian scabies was first described in patients with leprosy in Norway. Crusted scabies can occur after immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation, rheumatological conditions, chemotherapy for malignancy and in infection with HIV and HTLV-1. It can also occur in malnutrition, Down's syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized, especially those with physical or cognitive disability who are unable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many thousands of mites in skin lesions and can serve as 'core transmitters' for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities and nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are not genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those infected from these cases.
