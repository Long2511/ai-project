Spondylitis in a febrile young adult is likely to be infectious. Globally, tuberculosis is the main cause of infectious spon- dylitis. Spinal brucellosis may be equally common or even predominant in highly endemic countries, such as Afghanistan.

Other infectious causes of spondylitis mirror those of osteomyelitis and usually follow haematogenous spread from a distant site of infection. The spectrum of pathogens includes Staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic and non-pyogenic streptococci and Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella species. In addition, histoplasmosis, actinomycosis and melioidosis may be relevant causes depending on local epidemiology.
