Several blood cultures are taken but remain negative. Spu- tum samples are negative for acid-fast bacilli. A CT-guided biopsy of the lesion is performed without complications. Culture of the tissue sample reveals Brucella melitensis as the causative agent. No additional sites of infection are iden- tified on imaging. Importantly, there is no sign of endocar- ditis on echocardiography.

The presentation is classified as “complicated brucellosis" with spondylitis and para-vertebral abscess formation accord- ing to WHO criteria, which requires a prolonged course of antimicrobial combination therapy. The patient is treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and rifampicin 900mg daily for 16 weeks. Additionally, intramuscular strep- tomycin (1 g daily) is given for the first 3 weeks of treatment.
