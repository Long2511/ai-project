The fever subsides after several days and inflammation parameters return to normal several weeks after initiation of antimicrobial therapy. A second MRI at the end of treat- ment shows full resolution of the paravertebral abscess. One year post treatment completion, the patient shows no signs of relapse.

Brucellosis is a common zoonotic bacterial infection and an important differential diagnosis in prolonged febrile illness. Cur- rently, around 500 000 cases of brucellosis are reported to the WHO each year, with global incidence rates increasing. B. melitensis is the most common cause of brucellosis worldwide and mainly infects camels, sheep and goats. Frequent routes of animal-to-human transmission include consumption of unpas- teurized dairy products as well as exposure to bodily fluids and aerosols during animal birth or slaughter. The possibility of air- borne transmission requires special safety precautions while handling Brucella cultures in the laboratory (biosafety level 3).
