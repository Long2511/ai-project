A 33-year-old male refugee from Afghanistan presents to a German clinic with a 6-month history of recurrent fever, night sweats and progressive back pain. After leaving Afghan- istan with his wife and two children, the family first lived in a refugee camp in Iran. There, the patient started feeling ill about 6 months ago and was treated with tablets for several weeks. Initially he also received intragluteal injections. His symptoms subsided whilst on medication but recurred after the treatment ended. After crossing Turkey and Eastern Europe, the family reached Germany 4 months ago. All med- ical documents were lost during the journey.

The patient is afebrile and in fair general condition. Vital signs are normal. On examination, there is marked spinal tenderness in the lumbar region. The remaining examination is unremarkable.
