In the early stages, brucellosis usually presents as a non-focal febrile illness. Clinical signs and symptoms are non-specific and may include night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection develops frequently during the course of disease and may affect the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, central nervous or cardiovascular system.

Osteoarticular involvement is particularly common (up to 40% of cases) and often presents as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis or spondylitis.

Serological diagnostic tests are widely available but fail to distinguish current from past infection in areas of high ende- micity. Blood culture has a high sensitivity in acute disease and tissue culture is considered the gold standard in localized infection.
