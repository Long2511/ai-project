Brucellosis therapy generally requires a combination of antimicrobials with activity in the acidic intracellular environment, as well as a prolonged course of treatment to avoid treatment failure and relapse. Preferred drug combinations of brucellosis are doxycylin plus an aminoglycoside (streptomycin or genta- micin) or plus rifampicin. In neurobrucellosis, ceftriaxone is combined with doxycyclin and rifampicin. If contraindications occur, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole may be used. Treatment duration is between six weeks and several months depending upon organ manifestation and severity.

Although most osteoarticular complications can be treated with a standard course of 6 weeks' duration, brucella spondylitis requires prolonged treatment for at least 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Furthermore, surgical intervention may be required in cases of vertebral instability or epidural and paravertebral abscess formation.
