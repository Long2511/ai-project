There is no cure for patients with konzo because it results in a permanent spastic paraparesis. Management is therefore directed at support, symptomatic improvement and disease prevention. The majority of patients can walk with the aid of a stick or crutches and some will benefit from a wheelchair. Muscle relaxants have a limited role because of relative ineffectiveness as a result of the severity of the spasticity, and these agents' high long-term cost. Surgical treatment involving Achilles tendon lengthening operations have proved useful in improving mobilization in selected patients with konzo. Because of the severity of contractures in this patient, he should be assessed for surgery.
