There are three important features in our case: (1) the isolated involvement of motor neurons without any sensory and bladder involvement; (2) the absence of back pain; and (3) the acute onset with no progression over 2 years. These three clinical points make spinal tuberculosis, spinal cord infection or spinal malignancy very unlikely. Of note, his diet (and probably that of his siblings and other children in the village) for the 2 months before the illness was almost exclusively cassava, and the same disease has affected one of his siblings and more children in the neighborhood. Hence, a nutritional cause must be suspected.

The tropical myeloneuropathies that are nutritional in origin are konzo and lathyrism. Lathyrism in Africa occurs exclusively in Ethiopia. The clinical diagnosis in our patient is konzo. Konzo is a distinct form of tropical spastic paraparesis which occurs exclusively in cassava-growing areas in Africa.
