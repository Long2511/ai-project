Cassava is a staple food for more than 600 million people. It grows well in poor soils and is resistant to drought, plant diseases, insects and animal predators, but it contains cyanogenic glycosides, mainly linamarin. Processing disrupts the tubers releasing cyanide, which makes the food safe for human consumption. Konzo is associated with high intake of insufficiently processed cassava tubers in combination with low or absent levels of the essential amino acids methionine or cysteine. Oxidative stress and glutamate-mediated neuro-excitatory cell death appears likely to be the final pathogenic mechanism. This results in a clinically exclusive pattern of upper motor neurone disease.
