A 14-year-old boy presents to his local hospital in rural Tanzania with a history of difficulty in walking. He had been well until just over 2 years earlier when his illness suddenly started. He describes that he was walking home from school when he first noticed that his legs began to feel heavy and started to tremble, which caused him difficulty in walking, with a tendency to fall over. He slowly completed the journey home; and since that day, he has been unable to stand or walk unaided. He now stands on his toes and drags his legs around with the aid of a stick. He denies any history of fever, pain, sensory, bladder or bowel symptoms or disease progression.
