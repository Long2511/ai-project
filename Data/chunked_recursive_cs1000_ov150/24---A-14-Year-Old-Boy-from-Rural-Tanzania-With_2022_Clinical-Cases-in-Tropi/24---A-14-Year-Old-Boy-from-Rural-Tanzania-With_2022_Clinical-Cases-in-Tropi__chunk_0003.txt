Clinically, he is well nourished with normal vital signs. General examination is unremarkable. On neurological examination, he is fully orientated and higher mental function appears normal. Cranial nerves are normal but bilateral optic pallor was noted on fundoscopy. Limbs reveal signs of spastic paraparesis with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees. Power in the legs is graded 3 to 4 out of 5 (= just overcoming gravity), with the knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors involved to the greatest extent. There is bilateral hypertonia, hyperreflexia and sustained ankle clonus with extensor plantar responses. The arms are normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia. There is no impairment or loss of sensation. A lumbar lordosis with thoracic kyphoscoliosis is noticeable only on standing.
