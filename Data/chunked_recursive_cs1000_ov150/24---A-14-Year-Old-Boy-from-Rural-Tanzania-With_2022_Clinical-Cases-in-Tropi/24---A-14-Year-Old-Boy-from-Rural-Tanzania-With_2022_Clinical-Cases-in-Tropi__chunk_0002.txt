His history is otherwise unremarkable. He lives in a village in northern Tanzania in a rural area with limited agricultural suitability, where the main staple food crop is cassava. His diet for the 2 months before the illness was almost exclusively cassava. He has three other siblings, one of whom is similarly affected, whereas their parents remained fine. He mentions that identical cases had occurred in his own and neighbouring villages at around the same time.
