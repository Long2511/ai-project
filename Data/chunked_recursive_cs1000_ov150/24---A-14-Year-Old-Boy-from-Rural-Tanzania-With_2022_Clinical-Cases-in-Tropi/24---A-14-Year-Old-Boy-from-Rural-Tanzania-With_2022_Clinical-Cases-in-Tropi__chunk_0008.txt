The diagnostic criteria are symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or genitourinary involvement, an abrupt onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive course, occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other cases emerging at the same time, and no other cause found.

Its cause is attributed to chronic high dietary exposure of cyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava tubers, but the exact pathogenic mechanisms of konzo remain unknown.
