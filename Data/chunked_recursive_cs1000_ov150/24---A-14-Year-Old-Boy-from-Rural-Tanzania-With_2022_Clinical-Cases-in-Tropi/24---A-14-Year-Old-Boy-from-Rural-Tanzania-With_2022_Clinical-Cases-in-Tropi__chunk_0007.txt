At follow-up examination at 6 and 12 months, the findings were unchanged, with a permanent spastic paraparesis. The patient had not been referred for surgery because of the lack of resources and the extent of the epidemic, with many other similar cases in the community. He uses one stick with very restricted mobility and works as a shoe repairer in his village.

Konzo is a distinct form of tropical spastic paraparesis, which occurs exclusively in cassava-growing areas in Africa. The word "konzo" means "tied legs" in the language of the Yaka tribe in the DRC. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of a permanent but non-progressive form of spastic paraparesis related to cassava consumption. It occurs mainly as epidemics, typically during droughts, famines or armed conflict when there is an overreliance on cassava as a staple food for weeks or months. It also occurs in an endemic form but at much lower rates. It affects mainly children and breastfeeding mothers.
