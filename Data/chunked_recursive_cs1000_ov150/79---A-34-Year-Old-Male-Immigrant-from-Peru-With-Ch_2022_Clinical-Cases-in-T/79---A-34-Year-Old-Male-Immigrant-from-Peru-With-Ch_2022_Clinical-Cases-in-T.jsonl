For more than 12 years he has suffered from recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; the frequency of these episodes appears to have increased in the past 2 years.\n\nThe patient originates from northern Peru but has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He reports that his Peruvian wife and children are healthy, but that his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at the age of 45 and 28 years, respectively.\n\nThe patient is cachectic with a severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination is normal: He is afebrile, liver and spleen are not enlarged, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema."}

Haemoglobin was low at 12.4 g/dL, below the 13.5-17.5 reference. Total protein was low at 4.9 g/dL, compared to a reference of 6.0-8.0, and albumin was also low at 2.2 g/dL, compared to a reference of 3.5-5.0. The ESR was elevated at 26 mm/h, above the 1-14 reference, and the HIV test was negative.\n\nAbdominal CT scan and abdominal MRI are without any pathological findings. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy appeared macroscopically normal. Histology of a duodenal biopsy is shown in Fig. 79.1."}

{"id": "79---A-34-Year-Old-Male-Immigrant-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T__0004", "text": "Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and wasting are usually not associated with intestinal helminth infections. Therefore diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main helminth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wasting are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis (see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal protozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli might cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated from northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for S. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be ordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae of S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann technique should be performed. The latter has the advantage of being technically simple and providing results within a few hours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and urine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae."}

HTLV-1 is an important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome, and Peru is endemic for this retrovirus.

After the histopathology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent to the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respiratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral treatment with ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day × 7 days) was initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-infection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered from diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within weeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months was negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and was without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first time in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of the family and other household members revealed asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection of his wife and one of the two children"}

It is a poverty-associated neglected disease, endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Strongyloidiasis is not unusual in returning travellers, who typically present with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints and/or eosinophilia (see Case 20). In immunocompromised patients, the parasite may multiply massively, resulting in severe and potentially fatal complications, commonly called \"hyperinfection syndrome\". Corticosteroids play a major role as a risk factor for strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome. In addition, HTLV-1 infection is an important predisposing condition."}

It causes a Th1-predominant T-cell proliferation and a marked shift towards type 1 cytokines. This immunological imbalance affects the Th2-mediated control of S. stercoralis, with the risk of accelerated auto-infection leading to increased loads of Strongyloides adults and larvae.\n\nIn HIV/AIDS, T-cell response is shifted towards Th2 cytokines; therefore HIV infection is not usually associated with strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, even though some cases have been described, e.g. in the context of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)."}

Disseminated forms, which are characterized by invasion of extraintestinal tissues (apart from the lung passage of larvae), a more rapid progress and a high lethality, are more typically found in patients under corticosteroid therapy. Because patients with hyperinfection lack common hallmarks of strongyloidiasis, such as eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels, diagnosis is often delayed or missed.\n\nThe drug of choice for patients with strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome is ivermectin given over prolonged periods of time (e.g. 7 days for two or more cycles). Patients with signs of dissemination (e.g. larvae in urine) should be treated with ivermectin and albendazole in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent Gram-negative infections (e.g. sepsis or meningitis) commonly associated with larval dissemination."}

However, parenteral ivermectin is commonly administered in veterinary medicine and some case reports describe successful subcutaneous treatment with a veterinary formulation of the drug. Because treatment failures might occur, patients require close follow-up. Family members should be screened for both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1 infection. Patients originating from endemic countries should be screened for Strongyloides infection before initiation of any immunosuppressive therapy."}
