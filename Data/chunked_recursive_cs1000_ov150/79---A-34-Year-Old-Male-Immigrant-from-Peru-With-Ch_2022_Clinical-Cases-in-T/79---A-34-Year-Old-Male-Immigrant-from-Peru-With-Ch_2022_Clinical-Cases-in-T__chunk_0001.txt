A 34-year-old man presents to a hospital in Chile with a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea associated with colicky abdominal pain and weight loss of approximately 20 kg. For more than 12 years he has suffered from recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; the frequency of these episodes appears to have increased in the past 2 years.

The patient originates from northern Peru but has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He reports that his Peruvian wife and children are healthy, but that his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at the age of 45 and 28 years, respectively.

The patient is cachectic with a severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination is normal: He is afebrile, liver and spleen are not enlarged, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema.
