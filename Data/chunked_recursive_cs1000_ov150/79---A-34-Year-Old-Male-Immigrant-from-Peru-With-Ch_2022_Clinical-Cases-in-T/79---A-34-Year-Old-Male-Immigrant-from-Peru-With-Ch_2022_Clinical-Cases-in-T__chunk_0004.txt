Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and wasting are usually not associated with intestinal helminth infections. Therefore diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main helminth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wasting are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis (see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal protozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli might cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated from northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for S. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be ordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae of S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann technique should be performed. The latter has the advantage of being technically simple and providing results within a few hours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and urine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae.
