The patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopathology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent to the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respiratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral treatment with ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day × 7 days) was initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-infection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered from diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within weeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months was negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and was without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first time in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of the family and other household members revealed asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection of his wife and one of the two children
