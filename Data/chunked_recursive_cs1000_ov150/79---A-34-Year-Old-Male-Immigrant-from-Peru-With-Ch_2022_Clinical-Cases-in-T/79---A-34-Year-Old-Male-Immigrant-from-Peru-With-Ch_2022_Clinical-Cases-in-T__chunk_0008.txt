S. stercoralis is a soil-transmitted nematode, capable of maintaining chronic intestinal infection through a cycle of autoinfection. It is a poverty-associated neglected disease, endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Strongyloidiasis is not unusual in returning travellers, who typically present with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints and/or eosinophilia (see Case 20). In immunocompromised patients, the parasite may multiply massively, resulting in severe and potentially fatal complications, commonly called "hyperinfection syndrome". Corticosteroids play a major role as a risk factor for strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome. In addition, HTLV-1 infection is an important predisposing condition.
