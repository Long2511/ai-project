Management can be challenging in severely ill patients incapable of resorbing ivermectin from the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. in paralytic ileus, because no parenteral anthelminthic drugs are licensed for use in humans. However, parenteral ivermectin is commonly administered in veterinary medicine and some case reports describe successful subcutaneous treatment with a veterinary formulation of the drug. Because treatment failures might occur, patients require close follow-up. Family members should be screened for both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1 infection. Patients originating from endemic countries should be screened for Strongyloides infection before initiation of any immunosuppressive therapy.
