HTLV-1-associated S. stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome mostly presents as severe chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and wasting. Disseminated forms, which are characterized by invasion of extraintestinal tissues (apart from the lung passage of larvae), a more rapid progress and a high lethality, are more typically found in patients under corticosteroid therapy. Because patients with hyperinfection lack common hallmarks of strongyloidiasis, such as eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels, diagnosis is often delayed or missed.

The drug of choice for patients with strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome is ivermectin given over prolonged periods of time (e.g. 7 days for two or more cycles). Patients with signs of dissemination (e.g. larvae in urine) should be treated with ivermectin and albendazole in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent Gram-negative infections (e.g. sepsis or meningitis) commonly associated with larval dissemination.
