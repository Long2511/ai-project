Animal hookworm larvae enter the epidermis but are unable to cross the basement membrane and enter the human body. Confined to the skin, they are unable to complete their lifecycle as they would do in their animal host.
There usually is a pruritic papule at the site of larval entry.
A raised erythematous track starts progressing in an irregular fashion. The onset of symptoms and the speed by which the creeping eruption progresses vary between different hookworm species, but usually itching starts shortly after larval entry, and the elevated track appears 1 to 5 days later.
The skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but may occur in any part of the body that came into contact with infested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent affected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms may invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia.
