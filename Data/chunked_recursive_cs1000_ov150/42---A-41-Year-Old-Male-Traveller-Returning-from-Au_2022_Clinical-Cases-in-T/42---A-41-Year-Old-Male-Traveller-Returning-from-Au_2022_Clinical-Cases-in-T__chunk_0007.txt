Diagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history. Skin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in advance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests available, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases.
The treatment of choice is ivermectin (200µg/kg for 1-2 days.). Albendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindicated or not available. Albendazole 400 mg should be given twice daily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10–15% tds for 5 to 10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be difficult in multiple lesions.
Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor.
