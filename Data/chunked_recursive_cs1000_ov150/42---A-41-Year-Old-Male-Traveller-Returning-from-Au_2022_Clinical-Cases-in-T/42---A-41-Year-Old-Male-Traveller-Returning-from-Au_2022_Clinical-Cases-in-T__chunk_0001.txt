A 41-year-old male yoga teacher presents to a travel clinic in Europe because of itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs for the past week.
He has just returned from a 10-day trip to northern Australia where he attended a yoga seminar. On his way to Australia he had stopped over on a Thai island for a 3-day beach holiday. Just after his arrival in Australia he developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs. The itch is so intense that at times it keeps him awake at night.
There has been no fever, no cough or wheeze and he is otherwise completely well.

On both upper thighs there are a total of three reddish, serpiginous tracks, about 2 mm in width. The inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. The chest is clear. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.
