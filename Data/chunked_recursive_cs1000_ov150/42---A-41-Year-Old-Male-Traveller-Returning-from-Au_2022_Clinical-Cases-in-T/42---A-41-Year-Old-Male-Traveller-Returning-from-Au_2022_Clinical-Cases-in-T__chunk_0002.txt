The clinical syndrome is a creeping eruption. A creeping eruption is defined as a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern. The most common cause of creeping eruptions seen in returned travellers is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) caused by larvae of animal hookworms.
Creeping eruptions can also result from infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens, i.e. running larva), but this can easily be distinguished from CLM. S. stercoralis larvae move several centimetres an hour, that is considerably faster than larvae in cutaneous larva migrans. The eruptions in larva currens persist only for a few hours, whereby in CLM the track may stay for weeks.
Creeping eruptions can also be caused by adult nematodes such as Gnathostoma species and trematodes (Fasciola species). The larvae of parasitic flies have also been shown to cause creeping eruptions (migratory myiasis).
