Without treatment the lesion can persist for several months, and scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if hygiene is poor.
For prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should be dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In resource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual protection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair on the beach because towels may be covered with sand and therefore do not protect sufficiently.
