CLM is a creeping eruption resulting from accidental infestation of the human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense and Uncinaria stenocephala). It is one of the most common dermatoses in returning travellers from tropical destinations. Apart from its relevance in travel medicine, it is endemic in resource-poor communities in the developing world, particularly in Central and South America, the Caribbean and South and South-east Asia.
CLM occurs in most warm and humid climates and where stray dogs and cats are common, or pets are not treated regularly with anthelmintics. The animals pass hookworm ova with their stools, and the larval stages develop in sand or soil. CLM is usually acquired when walking barefoot, or sitting or lying on faecally contaminated ground.
