The pattern of transient subcutaneous swellings, eosinophilia and the history of living in Cameroon for several years are the key pieces of clinical information suggestive of a filarial infection.

Some filarial infections may affect the heart, and chronic eosinophilia is known to be cardiotoxic and may cause endomyocardial fibrosis. The cardiac findings in this patient, however, may warrant further work-up.
