The differentials of skin swellings and eosinophilia include non-specific urticaria, Calabar swellings in loiasis, cysticerco-sis, larva currens in Strongyloides stercoralis infection and infection with Mansonella perstans.
Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) may present with eosinophilia, fever and an urticarial rash; however, this patient is afebrile and the migratory swellings she describes do not fit the clinical picture of schistosomiasis.
Gnathostomiasis and sparganosis may also cause eosinophilia and migratory swellings; however, these infections are more common in East Asia than in Africa. Sparganosis has been reported from Kenya and Tanzania and gnathostomiasis occurs in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.
