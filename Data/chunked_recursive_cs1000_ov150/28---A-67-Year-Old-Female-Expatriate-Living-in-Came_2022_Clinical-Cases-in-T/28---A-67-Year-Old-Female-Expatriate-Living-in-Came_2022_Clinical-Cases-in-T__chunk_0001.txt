A 67-year-old German woman who has lived as an expatriate in Cameroon for the past 4 years presents with palpitations at a tropical medicine clinic in Germany. She also reports transient subcutaneous swellings for the past year. There is no history of fever or constitutional symptoms and the past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.
24-hour ECG recording was done elsewhere, which showed paroxysmal supraventricular extrasystoles. Echocardiography revealed a minimal pericardial effusion.

Vital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile. There are no visible subcutaneous swellings. Heart sounds are clear and regular, and there are no murmurs. No pathological findings are noted on physical examination.

Full blood count results are shown in Table 28.1.
