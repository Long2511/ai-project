Serology for filarial infections was positive. Day-blood samples were collected, filtered and stained with Giemsa, which revealed sheathed microfilariae with a tapered tail characteristic for Loa loa. In contrast, microfilariae of M. perstans, another filarial nematode endemic in West and Central Africa, which may cause similar symptoms, would have been smaller and unsheathed with a blunt tail. The microfilarial count was 1400/mL.
Despite the low microfilarial count the patient was treated with caution, first with albendazole followed by ivermectin. Therapy was tolerated well. The absolute eosinophil count (AEC) returned to normal and the microfilarial count declined. No sequelae were observed and the palpitations settled.
Follow-up echocardiography 3 months later was normal, the pericardial effusion had resolved and 24-hour ECG was also normal.
