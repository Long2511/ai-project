Treatment of loiasis is matched to the level of microfilaraemia. For high levels, over 8000 microfilariae per milliliter, the recommended regimen is albendazole 200mg twice daily for 21 days, followed by ivermectin 150µg/kg once, and then diethylcarbamazine (DEC) at slowly increasing doses. For moderate levels, between 2000 and 8000 microfilariae per milliliter, the recommendation is ivermectin 150µg/kg once, which should be repeated after 1 to 3 months until microfilaraemia falls below 2000 per milliliter, followed by treatment with DEC. For low levels, less than 2000 microfilariae per milliliter, treatment with DEC is advised. This should start with low doses of 3-6 mg per day if parasites are in the blood, or 50 mg per day if amicrofilaraemic, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose is then doubled daily up to 400 mg per day, also divided into 2-3 doses. This treatment should be initiated in a hospital setting
