A 46-year-old Thai woman is transferred to a German clinic for tropical diseases with a 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy and weight loss.
Despite various antibiotic therapies, clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers had deteriorated, resulting in hospital admission. Pus and blood cultures did not yield any growth, and histopathology of a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis. The symptoms started 6 to 8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. During her stay the patient had suffered from high fever, dry cough and fatigue.
