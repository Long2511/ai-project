Inhalation of fungal spores may lead to acute pulmonary histoplasmosis; however, approximately 90% of individuals with acute infection remain asymptomatic. In patients with underlying lung pathology, chronic pulmonary disease can occur. Patients develop cavities that may enlarge and result in necrosis. Untreated histoplasmosis may lead to progressive pulmonary fibrosis that leads to recurrent infections and respiratory and cardiac failure.
In children, older individuals and immunocompromised patients, dissemination of the infection may occur. The symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis typically include fever, malaise, anorexia and weight loss. Physical examination will often show hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, some patients may present with mucous membrane ulcerations as well as skin ulcers, nodules or molluscum-like papules. Rarely, disseminated infection can also occur in immunocompetent patients.
