A 46-year-old woman from Thailand presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy and weight loss. Her symptoms started 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. A radiograph of the swollen elbow reveals osteomyelitis.
