Pus and blood cultures did not yield any growth, and histopathology of a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis. The symptoms started 6 to 8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. During her stay the patient had suffered from high fever, dry cough and fatigue."}

Massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids. Disseminated fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, discharge of pus on slight pressure. Painful swelling of the left elbow. Otherwise normal physical examination.\n\nOn admission, laboratory results showed a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, which was above the reference range of 3.8-11. The haemoglobin level was 8.2 g/dL, below the reference of 12.3-15.3. The mean corpuscular volume was 88 fL, within the normal range of 80-94. The platelet count was elevated at 592 x 10⁹/L, compared to a reference range of 150-400. The C-reactive protein was 267 mg/L, significantly higher than the reference of less than 5, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was over 110 mm/h, far exceeding the reference value of less than 20."}

The patient received imipenem, which led to a slight improvement of her skin manifestations but inflammation parameters remained grossly elevated.\nOnce various cultures from skin and lymph node biopsies remained sterile, a submandibular lymph node was extirpated. Histologically, this lymph node showed fungal cells that were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR. This was later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative.\nIn retrospect, the febrile illness the patient had suffered whilst in Thailand may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis."}

CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, which, despite the absence of direct pathogen detection, may have been a cerebral manifestation of histoplasmosis.\nOn treatment with liposomal amphotericin B the patient's clinical state and the laboratory findings improved dramatically. The patient was started on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months.\nNo evidence of immunosuppression was found in the diagnostic work-up.\nOn follow-up the patient presented in a fair general condition. Some of the former abscess sites showed post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, enlarged lymph nodes were no longer present and the osteolytic lesions were partly recalcified. Repeat histoplasma serology remained negative."}

The fungus can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, predominantly in river valleys in parts of the USA, the West Indies, Central and South America, Africa, India, South East Asia and Australia. The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that favours mycelial growth. Highly contaminated soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through their droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years"}

In patients with underlying lung pathology, chronic pulmonary disease can occur. Patients develop cavities that may enlarge and result in necrosis. Untreated histoplasmosis may lead to progressive pulmonary fibrosis that leads to recurrent infections and respiratory and cardiac failure.\nIn children, older individuals and immunocompromised patients, dissemination of the infection may occur. The symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis typically include fever, malaise, anorexia and weight loss. Physical examination will often show hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, some patients may present with mucous membrane ulcerations as well as skin ulcers, nodules or molluscum-like papules. Rarely, disseminated infection can also occur in immunocompetent patients."}
{"id": "61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr__0009", "text": "In disseminated disease, culture of tissue samples or body fluids and histopathology should be obtained. PCR can help speed up the diagnostic process because isolation from fungal cultures takes up to 3 weeks. Serology lacks sensitivity, especially in immunocompromised patients. In these cases, blood and urine antigen testing should be performed.\nIn patients with disseminated infection, initial treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (3-5mg/kg daily) is highly effective. Itraconazole (400mg daily) is favoured for maintenance therapy. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of infection and the immune status of the patient. IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) guidelines recommends 6 to 18 months in total."}
