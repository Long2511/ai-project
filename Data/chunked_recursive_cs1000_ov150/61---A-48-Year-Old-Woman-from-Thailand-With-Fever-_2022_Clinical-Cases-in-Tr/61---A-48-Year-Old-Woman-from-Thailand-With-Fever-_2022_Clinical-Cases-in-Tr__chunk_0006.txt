Histoplasmosis is caused by H. capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that remains in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals. The fungus can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, predominantly in river valleys in parts of the USA, the West Indies, Central and South America, Africa, India, South East Asia and Australia. The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that favours mycelial growth. Highly contaminated soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through their droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years
