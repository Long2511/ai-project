In disseminated disease, culture of tissue samples or body fluids and histopathology should be obtained. PCR can help speed up the diagnostic process because isolation from fungal cultures takes up to 3 weeks. Serology lacks sensitivity, especially in immunocompromised patients. In these cases, blood and urine antigen testing should be performed.
In patients with disseminated infection, initial treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (3-5mg/kg daily) is highly effective. Itraconazole (400mg daily) is favoured for maintenance therapy. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of infection and the immune status of the patient. IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) guidelines recommends 6 to 18 months in total.
