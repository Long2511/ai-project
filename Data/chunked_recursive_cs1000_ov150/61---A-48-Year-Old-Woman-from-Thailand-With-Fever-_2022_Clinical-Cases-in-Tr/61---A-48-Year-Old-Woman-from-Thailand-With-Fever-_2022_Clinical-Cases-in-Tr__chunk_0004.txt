Initially, the clinically suspected diagnosis was melioidosis, which is a common cause of disseminated abscesses in patients from north-eastern Thailand. The patient received imipenem, which led to a slight improvement of her skin manifestations but inflammation parameters remained grossly elevated.
Once various cultures from skin and lymph node biopsies remained sterile, a submandibular lymph node was extirpated. Histologically, this lymph node showed fungal cells that were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR. This was later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative.
In retrospect, the febrile illness the patient had suffered whilst in Thailand may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.
