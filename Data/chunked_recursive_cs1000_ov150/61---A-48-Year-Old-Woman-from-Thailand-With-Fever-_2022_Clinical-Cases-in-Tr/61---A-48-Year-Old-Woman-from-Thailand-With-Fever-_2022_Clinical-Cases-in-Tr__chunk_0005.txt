In retrospect, the febrile illness the patient had suffered whilst in Thailand may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.
While on antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg per day, total dose 3 g) the patient developed a generalized seizure. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, which, despite the absence of direct pathogen detection, may have been a cerebral manifestation of histoplasmosis.
On treatment with liposomal amphotericin B the patient's clinical state and the laboratory findings improved dramatically. The patient was started on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months.
No evidence of immunosuppression was found in the diagnostic work-up.
On follow-up the patient presented in a fair general condition. Some of the former abscess sites showed post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, enlarged lymph nodes were no longer present and the osteolytic lesions were partly recalcified. Repeat histoplasma serology remained negative.
