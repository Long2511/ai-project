SFTS is an emerging infectious disease caused by infection with the SFTS virus and transmitted by tick bites. The first case was reported in China in 2009; and since then, cases have been reported in both Japan and Korea. As of 2019, 491 cases had been reported in Japan from when the first case was reported in 2012.

The SFTS virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, which also includes the Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and hantavirus. Its incubation period is 6 to 14 days. Despite being a tick-borne disease, it is reported that an eschar is rarely seen. Clinical manifestations of SFTS include fever, nausea, diarrhoea, arthralgia, myalgia and neurological symptoms. Laboratory results typically show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum AST, ALT, LDH and CK levels. Patients sometimes develop multi-organ failure and hemophagocytic syndrome, which results in a high case-fatality rate.
