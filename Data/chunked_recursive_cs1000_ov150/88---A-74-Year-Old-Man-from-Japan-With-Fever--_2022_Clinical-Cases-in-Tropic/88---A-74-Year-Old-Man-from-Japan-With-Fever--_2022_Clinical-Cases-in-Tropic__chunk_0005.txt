SFTS should be suspected when a patient at risk of tick bite develops acute fever with thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and an elevated serum creatinine kinase. SFTS and rickettsioses are sometimes difficult to differentiate from each other because both show similar clinical manifestations and laboratory results. In this case, however, a negative CRP is suggestive of SFTS rather than rickettsiosis.

Diagnosis of SFTS is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR. It is reported that real-time RT-PCR of serum is 98.6% sensitive and 99.1% specific.
