The patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit immediately. Meropenem and vancomycin were initiated for possible bacterial sepsis. His blood sample was sent to the reference laboratory, and SFTS virus PCR came back positive. Antibiotics were subsequently discontinued because no bacterial infection was identified.

Despite adequate fluid administration and other supportive therapies, the patient experienced worsening of his respiratory condition and protracted hypotension for a week. Noradrenaline was initiated, and then hydrocortisone 200 mg/day was added for non-responsive septic shock before he started showing gradual improvement. His platelet count decreased to 65 × 10⁹/L on day 4 of admission but subsequently recovered to the normal level. His CK was highest on admission and decreased to the normal level on day 7.

He was extubated on day 12 and discharged on day 35 without any sequelae.
