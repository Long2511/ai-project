Symptomatic and supportive treatment such as adequate fluid administration and respiratory support play an essential role in management. Vasopressors should be started if the patient develops hypotension. Laboratory results have to be monitored closely because there are risks of worsening thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure and haemophagocytic syndrome. Antibiotics should be administered until the PCR result is available and other infectious diseases have been ruled out.

Medical staff should be aware that there is a chance of human-to-human transmission through blood or body fluids. Contact precaution is needed until the SFTS viral load becomes undetectable.
