His Haemoglobin was 17.7 g/dL, which is above the reference range of 13.7-16.8 g/dL. The patient's Platelet count was low at 90 x 10⁹/L, below the reference range of 158-348. The AST level was significantly elevated at 413 U/L, compared to the reference range of 13-30 U/L, and the ALT was also high at 95 U/L, against a reference of 10-42 U/L. The LDH was 1025 U/L, far exceeding the reference range of 124-222 U/L. The CK level was exceptionally high at 7442 U/L, compared to a normal range of 59-248 U/L. CK-MB was also elevated at 41 U/L, above the reference of 0-15 U/L. The CRP level was 0.1 mg/dL, which is within the normal range of 0.00-0.14 mg/dL.\n\nA 74-year-old man living in south-western Japan presents with fever, arthralgia, impaired consciousness and respiratory distress. Laboratory results show elevated AST/ALT, LDH, CK and low platelets."}

Pneumonia, meningitis or infective endocarditis need to be investigated as soon as possible. In addition, considering the patient's lifestyle and habitat, tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases should be included in the differential diagnosis. There are two rickettsial infections and one viral infection that are transmitted by mites or ticks, respectively, in Japan: Japanese spotted fever (caused by Rickettsia japonica), scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)."}

SFTS and rickettsioses are sometimes difficult to differentiate from each other because both show similar clinical manifestations and laboratory results. In this case, however, a negative CRP is suggestive of SFTS rather than rickettsiosis.\n\nDiagnosis of SFTS is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR. It is reported that real-time RT-PCR of serum is 98.6% sensitive and 99.1% specific."}

Vasopressors should be started if the patient develops hypotension. Laboratory results have to be monitored closely because there are risks of worsening thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure and haemophagocytic syndrome. Antibiotics should be administered until the PCR result is available and other infectious diseases have been ruled out.\n\nMedical staff should be aware that there is a chance of human-to-human transmission through blood or body fluids. Contact precaution is needed until the SFTS viral load becomes undetectable."}

Meropenem and vancomycin were initiated for possible bacterial sepsis. His blood sample was sent to the reference laboratory, and SFTS virus PCR came back positive. Antibiotics were subsequently discontinued because no bacterial infection was identified.\n\nDespite adequate fluid administration and other supportive therapies, the patient experienced worsening of his respiratory condition and protracted hypotension for a week. Noradrenaline was initiated, and then hydrocortisone 200 mg/day was added for non-responsive septic shock before he started showing gradual improvement. His platelet count decreased to 65 × 10⁹/L on day 4 of admission but subsequently recovered to the normal level. His CK was highest on admission and decreased to the normal level on day 7.\n\nHe was extubated on day 12 and discharged on day 35 without any sequelae."}

The first case was reported in China in 2009; and since then, cases have been reported in both Japan and Korea. As of 2019, 491 cases had been reported in Japan from when the first case was reported in 2012.\n\nThe SFTS virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, which also includes the Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and hantavirus. Its incubation period is 6 to 14 days. Despite being a tick-borne disease, it is reported that an eschar is rarely seen. Clinical manifestations of SFTS include fever, nausea, diarrhoea, arthralgia, myalgia and neurological symptoms. Laboratory results typically show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum AST, ALT, LDH and CK levels. Patients sometimes develop multi-organ failure and hemophagocytic syndrome, which results in a high case-fatality rate."}

There is no effective antiviral agent against SFTS. Patients require close monitoring of their respiratory condition and blood pressure. Adequate fluid administration, close monitoring and management of thrombocytopenia, haemophagocytic syndrome and secondary bacterial infection are important.\n\nThe case-fatality rate has been reported to range from 6.3% to 30% in China and be 23.2% in Japan. Older age, impaired consciousness and high serum LDH and CK levels are associated with high lethality."}
