Acute fever with respiratory distress and impaired consciousness are signs of sepsis. Pneumonia, meningitis or infective endocarditis need to be investigated as soon as possible. In addition, considering the patient's lifestyle and habitat, tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases should be included in the differential diagnosis. There are two rickettsial infections and one viral infection that are transmitted by mites or ticks, respectively, in Japan: Japanese spotted fever (caused by Rickettsia japonica), scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).
