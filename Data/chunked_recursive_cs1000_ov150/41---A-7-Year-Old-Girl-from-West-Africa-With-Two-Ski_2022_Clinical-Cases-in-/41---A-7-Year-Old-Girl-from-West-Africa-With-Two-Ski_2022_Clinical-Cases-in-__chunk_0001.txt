A 7-year-old girl is presented to a district hospital in the tropical region of a West African country. After an insect bite, she developed an itchy papule on the back of her right hand, which enlarged over a period of 3 months. A traditional healer had prescribed herbal remedies. When the lesion ulcerated a few weeks later, diclofenac and dexamethasone were administered at the local health post. When a second lesion appeared, treatment with oxacillin was initiated with no effect. The girl became increasingly unable to use her right hand. There is no history of relevant trauma or systemic symptoms.
