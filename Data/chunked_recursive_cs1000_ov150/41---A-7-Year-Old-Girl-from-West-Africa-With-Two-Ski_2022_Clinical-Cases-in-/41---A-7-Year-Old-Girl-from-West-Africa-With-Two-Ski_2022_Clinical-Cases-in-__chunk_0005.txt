The indication for surgical debridement depends on the clinical picture, but also on the availability of adequate anaesthetic and surgical care.

BU-specific antimycobacterial therapy should be commenced as soon as possible. In the absence of systemic symptoms, the toxicity of the recommended antibiotic treatment may justify a few days of delay until diagnostic results have been obtained.

PCR from a wound swab confirmed the presence of M. ulcerans. During the 8 weeks of specific treatment and wound care the ulcer on the back of the hand healed almost completely, but the second smaller ulcer increased to 8 × 10 cm in size.

Debridement and skin grafting were performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. The restriction of movement was corrected by physiotherapy.
