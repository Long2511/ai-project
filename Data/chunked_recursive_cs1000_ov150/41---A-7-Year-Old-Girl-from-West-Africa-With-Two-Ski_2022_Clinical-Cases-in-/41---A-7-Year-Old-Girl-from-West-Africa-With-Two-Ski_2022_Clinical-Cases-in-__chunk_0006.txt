M. ulcerans disease is a necrotizing infection mainly of the subcutaneous tissue. It is most prevalent among children and adolescents living in rural communities of West Africa; but other continents and temperate regions of Australia, China and Japan are also affected. Endemic areas are associated with water bodies such as rivers and lakes. However, the exact mode of transmission remains poorly understood.

M. ulcerans is characterized by its particular sensitivity to heat, its propensity to develop local and distant satellite lesions and its production of a necrotizing, locally immunosuppressive and analgesic macrolide exotoxin called mycolactone.
