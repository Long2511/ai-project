Adequate wound care, including pain relief, according to WHO guidelines should be instituted immediately. The desired sterile, moist atmosphere of the wound can be achieved with saline-soaked gauze changed daily. Colonization with other bacteria may be controlled by povidone-iodine. Antitetanus coverage must be secured. Written documentation of pain control and picture documentation of wound progress is helpful in achieving or maintaining a high-quality wound management standard.

Laboratory confirmation of BU by M. ulcerans using PCR is desirable but limited by the availability of reliable laboratory capacity and by its cost, which must be balanced with important supportive measures, such as improved nutrition.

The indication for surgical debridement depends on the clinical picture, but also on the availability of adequate anaesthetic and surgical care.
