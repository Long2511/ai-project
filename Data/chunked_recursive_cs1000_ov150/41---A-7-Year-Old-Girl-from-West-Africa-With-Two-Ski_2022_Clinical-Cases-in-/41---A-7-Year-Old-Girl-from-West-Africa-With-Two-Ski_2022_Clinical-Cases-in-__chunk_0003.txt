The geographical region of West Africa, the young age of the patient, the location of the lesion on the extremities, the absence of major trauma and the clinical picture lead to a suspected diagnosis diagnosis of Buruli ulcer (BU). The history of an insect bite is an incidental finding, the mode of transmission of the causative organism, Mycobacterium ulcerans, remains unknown.
Pain and low-grade fever as seen in this case may also be explained by bacterial superinfection. A careful history and physical examination will provide guidance in differentiating numerous other infectious (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) and non-infectious (trauma, envenoming, autoimmune, haematological, neoplastic) causes of ulcers in tropical countries. In areas endemic for BU, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in experienced hands is remarkably high.
