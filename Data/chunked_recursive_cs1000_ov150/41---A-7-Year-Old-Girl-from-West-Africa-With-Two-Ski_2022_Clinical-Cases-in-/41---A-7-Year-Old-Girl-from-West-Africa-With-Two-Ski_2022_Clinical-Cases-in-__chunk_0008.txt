The WHO recommends combination therapy with rifampicin (10mg/kg per day PO) plus either streptomycin (15 mg/kg per day IM) or clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg twice daily PO) for 8 weeks, which achieve high specific cure rates. Local heat application at temperatures >40°C for several weeks has also been shown to be curative. Special attention must be paid to patients co-infected with HIV, who are at increased risk for complications.
