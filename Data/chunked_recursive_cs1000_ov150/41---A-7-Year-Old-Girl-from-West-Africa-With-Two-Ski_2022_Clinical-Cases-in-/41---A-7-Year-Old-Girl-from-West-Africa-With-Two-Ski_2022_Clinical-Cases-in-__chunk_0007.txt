Clinically, M. ulcerans disease presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules and plaques to the eponymous ulcers. The latter may involve most of a limb surface or trunk and can simultaneously occur at different body sites. All lesions share skin alterations including induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation and possibly local oedema. Ulcers are characterized by undermined edges surrounding a 'cotton wool' like necrosis. Lesions are classically described as painless, but evidence has emerged questioning this doctrine. The diagnosis can be confirmed most reliably by PCR from a wound swab; however, a test for the presence of mycolactone suitable for district-level laboratories is under investigation.
