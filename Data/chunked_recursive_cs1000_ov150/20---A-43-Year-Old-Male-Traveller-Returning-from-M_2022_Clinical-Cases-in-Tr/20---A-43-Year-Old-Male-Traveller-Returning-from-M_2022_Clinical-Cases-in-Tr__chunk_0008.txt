Diagnosis of acute schistosomiasis can be challenging. Schistosoma ova may still be absent from urine or stool at this early stage and serological tests can take up to 3 months to become positive. As a consequence, these investigations have to be repeated several times after the diagnosis has been clinically suspected. PCR-based methods are promising for the diagnosis of acute Schistosoma infection in recently primarily exposed populations such as travellers.
Praziquantel has a lack of activity against immature flukes and severe reactions have been reported after praziquantel treatment during the acute phase. Therefore antiparasitic treatment should be delayed until the flukes are adult, i.e. until eggs can be detected in stool or urine.
Under certain circumstances, such as severe symptoms and in particular neurological complications, supportive steroid therapy may be useful in Katayama syndrome.
