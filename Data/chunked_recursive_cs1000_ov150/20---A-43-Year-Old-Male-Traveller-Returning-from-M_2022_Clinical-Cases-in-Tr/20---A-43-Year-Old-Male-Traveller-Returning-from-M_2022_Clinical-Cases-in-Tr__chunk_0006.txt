In any patient returning from the tropics with eosinophilia, a helminth infection should be ruled out. The most relevant differential diagnosis in this patient who presents with eosinophilia and fever reporting freshwater contact is acute schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama syndrome. Another rare cause of fever, eosinophilia and elevated liver transaminases is acute fascioliasis.

Thick films for Plasmodium species were negative. Microscopy of stool and urine samples for Schistosoma eggs were three times negative.
The patient was tested for antischistosomal antibodies using an enzyme-immunoassay and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA); both came back negative.
Four weeks later antischistosomal antibodies could be detected (IFA 1:1280, cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive). S. mansoni ova were found in the stool and a diagnosis of schistosomiasis was established. The patient was treated with praziquantel.
