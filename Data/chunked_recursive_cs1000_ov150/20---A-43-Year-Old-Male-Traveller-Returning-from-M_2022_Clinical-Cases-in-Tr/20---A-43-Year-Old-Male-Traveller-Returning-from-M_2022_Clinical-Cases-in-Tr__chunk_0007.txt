Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) is an acute hypersensitivity reaction caused by newly expressed antigens on developing worms. It is named after the Katayama region in Japan, where it was first described.
Katayama syndrome usually occurs 2 to 12 weeks after Schistosoma infection. It is characterized by fever, urticaria and a dry cough sometimes accompanied by a wheeze. Patchy pulmonary infiltrates or micronodular changes in the lower lung zones may be present on chest radiograph. Full blood count in the majority of cases shows eosinophilia, but of note, eosinophilia can occur with a delay of several weeks after the onset of symptoms and may be missed. Most patients recover spontaneously after 2 to 10 weeks. Rarely, neurological complications can occur, e.g. transverse myelitis, conus medullaris or cauda equina syndrome.
