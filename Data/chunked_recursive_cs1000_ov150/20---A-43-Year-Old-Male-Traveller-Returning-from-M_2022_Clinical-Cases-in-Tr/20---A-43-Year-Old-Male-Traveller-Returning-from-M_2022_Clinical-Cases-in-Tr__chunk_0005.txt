EBV and CMV infections may also cause fever, elevated liver enzymes and a rise in LDH. They are important differentials of fever in returned travellers. However, EBV and CMV cause lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, rather than eosinophilia. Splenomegaly is usually part of the clinical picture of mononucleosis and lymphadenopathy, even though the latter can be less prominent in acute CMV infection.
Leptospirosis, rickettsioses and Q-fever are bacterial infections to consider, as well as brucellosis, secondary syphilis and relapsing fever. Yet none of these infections as such would explain the patient's pronounced eosinophilia.
