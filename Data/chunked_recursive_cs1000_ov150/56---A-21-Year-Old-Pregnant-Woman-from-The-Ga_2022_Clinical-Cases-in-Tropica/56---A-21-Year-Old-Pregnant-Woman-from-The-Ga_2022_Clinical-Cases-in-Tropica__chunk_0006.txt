Serological tests for syphilis are either treponemal (e.g. TPHA, TPPA), or non-treponemal (e.g. RPR or VDRL). Treponemal tests remain positive for life, whereas non-treponemal tests usually revert to negative after successful treatment, and can therefore be used as a test of cure. They may give false-positive results because of other infections (e.g. malaria), or autoimmune diseases. Until recently it has not been possible to screen women attending antenatal clinics that do not have access to a laboratory. However, sensitive and specific treponemal point-of-care tests are now available at an affordable price (<$1) which can give a result in 15 minutes and require neither electricity nor laboratory equipment.
