According to current WHO estimates, syphilis in pregnancy causes 355,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes per year, including 143,000 early foetal deaths and stillbirths and 61,000 neonatal deaths. These could be prevented if all pregnant women were screened for syphilis, and treated with a single dose of penicillin if they test positive, before 28 weeks' gestation.
