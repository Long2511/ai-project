Primary syphilis causes an ulcer or chancre, at the site of inoculation, which is usually painless. Women are often unaware of the lesion, because it may be on the cervix or vaginal wall. The secondary stage usually occurs 6 to 8 weeks later, causing a generalized rash that often affects the palms of the hands, and usually does not itch. There may be other manifestations, including jaundice or ocular involvement (uveitis). The clinical signs resolve over a few weeks in the absence of treatment, after which the patient enters the latent stage. A small minority develop tertiary lesions involving the cardiovascular or nervous system many years later. Progression may be more rapid in HIV-positive patients. Women with secondary syphilis, who have a disseminated infection, are most likely to infect their foetus, but the infection can cross the placenta in pregnant women with latent syphilis.
