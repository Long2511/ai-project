A generalized, non-itchy rash affecting the palms of the hands is syphilis until proven otherwise. Syphilis in pregnancy has a serious influence on pregnancy outcome. A study in Tanzania showed that, among women with latent syphilis and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titre of ≥1:8, 25% delivered a stillborn baby, and 33% a low-birth-weight baby.

The baby may be born with signs of congenital syphilis, including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. In this case the prognosis is bad, with a 50% case fatality rate even with treatment. Alternatively, the baby may appear normal at birth, and present at the age of 3 to 4 months with failure to thrive and signs of congenital syphilis, usually including a generalized rash which affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Other common signs include hepatosplenomegaly, painful periostitis involving the long bones, and a persistent nasal discharge, which may be bloodstained (the 'syphilitic snuffles').
