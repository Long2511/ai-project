Intramuscular benzathine penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis. A single dose of 2.4 million units i.m. is recommended for primary, secondary and early latent syphilis (of less than two years' duration). A single dose, given before 28 weeks' gestation, has been shown to prevent adverse outcomes resulting from syphilis. Because this patient has not been treated before 28 weeks, her infant should receive a course of treatment for congenital syphilis (IM procaine penicillin 50000 units/kg daily for 10–14 days)

The patient was treated with a single IM dose of benzathine penicillin and she made an uneventful recovery. She delivered a normal infant at term.
