Treatment includes azoles for mild and moderate cases. Itraconazole (200mg/day for 12 months) is considered the drug of choice. Voriconazole and co-trimoxazole are alternatives; the latter is commonly used in Brazil. Amphotericin B (cumulative dose of 1-2g) is indicated for severe and extensive disease. However, the drug is not curative and should be followed by an azole or co-trimoxazole to complete 12 months' treatment.

Cure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical (i.e. absence of symptoms), mycological (i.e. negative testing), radiological (i.e. stability of lung lesions on x-ray for 1 year) and immunological (i.e. decrease of specific antibodies).

Recently case reports of severe and unusual extrapulmonary manifestations of paracoccidioidomycosis have been described in HTLV-1 infected patients and the two conditions might be associated.
