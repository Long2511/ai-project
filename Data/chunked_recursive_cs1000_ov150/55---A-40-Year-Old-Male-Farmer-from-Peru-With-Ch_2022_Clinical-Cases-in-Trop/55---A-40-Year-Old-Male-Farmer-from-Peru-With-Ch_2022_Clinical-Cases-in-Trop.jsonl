The patient reports dyspnoea on exertion and weight loss of about 20 kg. He denies diarrhoea, fever or night sweats.\n\nThree and half months earlier, the patient was hospital-ized at a regional hospital in the Peruvian Amazon for similar complaints. During the hospitalization, three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were reported negative. No tuber-culin skin test was performed. The chest radiograph was described as abnormal but no report is available and the patient does not have the film. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical presentation and abnormal chest radiographic findings. The patient received first line TB therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifam-picin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol."}

He was then referred to Lima with a suspected diagnosis of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB) for further work-up.\n\nThe patient had been found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously. A recent HIV ELISA test was negative. The patient denies recent travels.\n\nA 40-year-old man appears fatigued and cachectic. Temper-ature 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, pulse 70bpm regular, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute. On inspection, few cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes are palpable, which are small, mobile, soft and non-tender. Lungs: crackles and rhonchi bilaterally. No hepatosplenomegaly.

TB is highly endemic in Peru and MDR TB is an increasing issue. TB and MDR TB almost always need to be considered when clinical symptoms and evolution, as in this case, are suggestive of the disease. What would be unusual about this patient is his origin from a rural area in the central Peruvian Amazon where MDR TB is still uncom-mon in comparison with underprivileged districts of Lima and other big cities of Peru."}
{"id": "55---A-40-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop__0005", "text": "Histoplasmosis can present with recurrent or progressive pulmonary symptoms that can mimic TB. However, his presentation would suggest a chronic form that is more often seen in individuals with preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which this patient does not have. The patient's age, gender, occupation, origin and clinical symp-toms with a pulmonary focus are all typical of the chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis and make this diagnosis the most likely of the three. Co-infection of TB (non-MDR) and paracoccidioidomycosis are not uncommon and should also be kept in mind as a possible differential. Parasitic infec-tions such as paragonimiasis or pulmonary hydatid cyst are also possible diagnoses, though less common. Imaging (chest radiography and CT scan) will help identifying the typical lesions of these infections."}
{"id": "55---A-40-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop__0006", "text": "The first step in this patient is to evaluate him for MDR TB. Initial investigations should include chest radiography (the patient should also be asked to bring the initial chest x-ray and report for comparison), tuberculin skin test (PPD) and repeated AFB sputum smears and sputum-PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) for M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial culture should complete the evaluation and, if positive, culture-based drug sensitivity testing should be added. Locally endemic fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis) should be evaluated by direct examination of sputum with wet mount potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and cultures. Depending on chest radiographic findings, local availability and costs, a CT scan of the chest could be considered as well as bronchoscopy with biopsy if less invasive diagnostic evaluation is unrevealing. The thrombocytosis should be confirmed on a smear."}

The chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates and multiple cavities in the right lung (Fig. 55.1).\n\nParacoccidioidomycosis has two main clinical forms: the chronic adult form and the acute juvenile form. The chronic form accounts for over 90% of cases, while the acute form accounts for less than 10%.\n\nThe chronic form primarily infects men over 30 years old, with a male-to-female ratio of 14 to 1. It is characterized by a chronic, slow progression that represents a reactivation years after the initial exposure. This form always involves the lungs, can disseminate to the liver and lymph nodes, and causes mucocutaneous lesions in the face, nasal, and oral cavity in approximately 70% of cases. It can mimic other chronic fungal infections and pulmonary TB."}

It has an acute or sub-acute onset, is rapidly progressive, and develops soon after recent exposure. This form presents as a systemic disease of the reticuloendothelial system, disseminating from the lungs to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, with mucosal lesions being rare. In HIV patients, the presentation is similar but includes cutaneous lesions and severe pulmonary involvement. The acute form can mimic leukaemia, lymphoma, or severe disseminated TB.\n\nTreatment for the chronic form includes azoles, such as itraconazole, or co-trimoxazole. For the acute form, treatment also includes azoles like itraconazole, with amphotericin B used for patients with HIV or severe disease.\n\nExamination of his sputum (KOH preparation) revealed the characteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Fig. 55.2).

The thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the underlying chronic infection.

TB treatment was discontinued.\n\nOur patient was HTLV-1 positive. His symptoms were confined to the lungs as in the chronic adult form of paracoccidioidomycosis (see Summary Box), but his pulmonary lesions were unusually extensive.

The infection is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which grows as mould in the environment and as yeast in tissue and at 37°C. Humans are infected through the inhalation of aerosolized conidia (spores) from the soil. In endemic areas, initial exposure occurs in childhood and the majority of primary infections remain asymptomatic or subclinical. In those who develop disease, two main clinical forms are observed (Table 55.1). The chronic adult form is characterized by pulmonary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in middle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often accompanied by mucosal lesions. Women of fertile age are rarely affected, probably because of a protective effect of oestradiol preventing the transformation of the fungus into the yeast stage"}

The identification of P. brasiliensis is more difficult in sputum than in skin lesions or material from lymph nodes. The yeast is easily observed on KOH preparation but its isolation in culture is difficult and takes 20 to 30 days. Serological testing is useful for antibody detection and diagnosis, assessing disease severity and monitoring treatment response. Molecular methods could be used instead of culture to confirm the diagnosis but are not yet widely available in resource-limited endemic areas."}

Itraconazole (200mg/day for 12 months) is considered the drug of choice. Voriconazole and co-trimoxazole are alternatives; the latter is commonly used in Brazil. Amphotericin B (cumulative dose of 1-2g) is indicated for severe and extensive disease. However, the drug is not curative and should be followed by an azole or co-trimoxazole to complete 12 months' treatment.\n\nCure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical (i.e. absence of symptoms), mycological (i.e. negative testing), radiological (i.e. stability of lung lesions on x-ray for 1 year) and immunological (i.e. decrease of specific antibodies).\n\nRecently case reports of severe and unusual extrapulmonary manifestations of paracoccidioidomycosis have been described in HTLV-1 infected patients and the two conditions might be associated."}
