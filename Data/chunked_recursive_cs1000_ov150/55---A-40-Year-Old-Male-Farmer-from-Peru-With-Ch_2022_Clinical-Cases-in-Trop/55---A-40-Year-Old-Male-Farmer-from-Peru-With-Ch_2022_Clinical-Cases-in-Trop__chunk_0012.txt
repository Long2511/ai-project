Diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis (yeast form) on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal culture. The identification of P. brasiliensis is more difficult in sputum than in skin lesions or material from lymph nodes. The yeast is easily observed on KOH preparation but its isolation in culture is difficult and takes 20 to 30 days. Serological testing is useful for antibody detection and diagnosis, assessing disease severity and monitoring treatment response. Molecular methods could be used instead of culture to confirm the diagnosis but are not yet widely available in resource-limited endemic areas.
