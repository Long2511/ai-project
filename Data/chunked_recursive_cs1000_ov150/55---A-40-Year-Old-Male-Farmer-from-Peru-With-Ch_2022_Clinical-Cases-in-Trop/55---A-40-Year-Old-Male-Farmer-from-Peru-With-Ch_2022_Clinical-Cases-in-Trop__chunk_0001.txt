A 40-year-old farmer from the Peruvian Amazon is referred to a hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough and chest pain. The patient reports dyspnoea on exertion and weight loss of about 20 kg. He denies diarrhoea, fever or night sweats.

Three and half months earlier, the patient was hospital-ized at a regional hospital in the Peruvian Amazon for similar complaints. During the hospitalization, three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were reported negative. No tuber-culin skin test was performed. The chest radiograph was described as abnormal but no report is available and the patient does not have the film. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical presentation and abnormal chest radiographic findings. The patient received first line TB therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifam-picin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.
