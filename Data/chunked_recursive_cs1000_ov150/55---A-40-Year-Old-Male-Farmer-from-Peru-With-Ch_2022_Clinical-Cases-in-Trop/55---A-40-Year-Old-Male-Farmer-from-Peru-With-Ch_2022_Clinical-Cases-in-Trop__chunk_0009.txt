A diagnosis of chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis was made. The thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the underlying chronic infection. Given the extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole (as opposed to itraconazole alone). TB treatment was discontinued.

Our patient was HTLV-1 positive. His symptoms were confined to the lungs as in the chronic adult form of paracoccidioidomycosis (see Summary Box), but his pulmonary lesions were unusually extensive. His long-term prognosis depends on the extent of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae.
