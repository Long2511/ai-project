The first step in this patient is to evaluate him for MDR TB. Initial investigations should include chest radiography (the patient should also be asked to bring the initial chest x-ray and report for comparison), tuberculin skin test (PPD) and repeated AFB sputum smears and sputum-PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) for M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial culture should complete the evaluation and, if positive, culture-based drug sensitivity testing should be added. Locally endemic fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis) should be evaluated by direct examination of sputum with wet mount potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and cultures. Depending on chest radiographic findings, local availability and costs, a CT scan of the chest could be considered as well as bronchoscopy with biopsy if less invasive diagnostic evaluation is unrevealing. The thrombocytosis should be confirmed on a smear.
