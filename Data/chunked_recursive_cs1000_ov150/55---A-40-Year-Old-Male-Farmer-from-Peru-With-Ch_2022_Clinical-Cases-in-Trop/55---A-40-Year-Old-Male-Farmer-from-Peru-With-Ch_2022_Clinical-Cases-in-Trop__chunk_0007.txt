The tuberculin skin test was negative as were two AFB smears. The chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates and multiple cavities in the right lung (Fig. 55.1).

Paracoccidioidomycosis has two main clinical forms: the chronic adult form and the acute juvenile form. The chronic form accounts for over 90% of cases, while the acute form accounts for less than 10%.

The chronic form primarily infects men over 30 years old, with a male-to-female ratio of 14 to 1. It is characterized by a chronic, slow progression that represents a reactivation years after the initial exposure. This form always involves the lungs, can disseminate to the liver and lymph nodes, and causes mucocutaneous lesions in the face, nasal, and oral cavity in approximately 70% of cases. It can mimic other chronic fungal infections and pulmonary TB.
