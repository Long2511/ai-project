The acute form affects children and young adults of both sexes, and rarely, HIV patients. It has an acute or sub-acute onset, is rapidly progressive, and develops soon after recent exposure. This form presents as a systemic disease of the reticuloendothelial system, disseminating from the lungs to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, with mucosal lesions being rare. In HIV patients, the presentation is similar but includes cutaneous lesions and severe pulmonary involvement. The acute form can mimic leukaemia, lymphoma, or severe disseminated TB.

Treatment for the chronic form includes azoles, such as itraconazole, or co-trimoxazole. For the acute form, treatment also includes azoles like itraconazole, with amphotericin B used for patients with HIV or severe disease.
