After 4 weeks, the blood cultures taken initially grew Brucella melitensis biovar 2. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation attached to the prosthetic mitral valve (Fig. 76.1). These findings led to the diagnosis of active Brucella endocarditis. Treatment with rifampicin, doxycycline and gentamicin was initiated. The patient improved rapidly. C-reactive protein returned to normal after 6 weeks of triple therapy. Two months later, however, an annular abscess cavity around the aortic prosthesis was demonstrated on echocardiography; the patient at that time was on oral rifampicin and doxycycline. Finally, she gave her consent to a third thoracotomy, for prostheses exchange. After surgery she made a complete and sustained recovery.
