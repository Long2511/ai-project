There is slight anaemia (Hb 11.5 g/dL [reference >12 g/dL]). White blood cell count, lymphocyte-neutrophil ratio and platelet count are within normal limits. The C-reactive protein is 15 mg/dL (reference <0.5 mg/dL). Serum creatinine and transaminases are not elevated. Blood cultures are negative. Urinary cultures yield Enterobacteriaceae.

Chest radiography shows no infiltrates. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates competent prosthetic valves.
The patient is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with co-trimoxazole. Her fever settles and the patient's condition improves, but she complains of increasing dyspnoea and eventually slips into congestive heart failure.

A 55-year old Turkish woman presents with fever of unknown origin. She has travelled to Turkey shortly before and has a history of double heart valve replacement. Treatment with co-trimoxazole results in some improvement, but then the patient develops signs of congestive heart failure.
