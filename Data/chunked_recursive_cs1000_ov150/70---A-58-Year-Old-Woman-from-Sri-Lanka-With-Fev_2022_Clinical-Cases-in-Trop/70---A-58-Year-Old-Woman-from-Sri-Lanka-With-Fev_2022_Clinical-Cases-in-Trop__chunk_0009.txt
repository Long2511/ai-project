CNS involvement is common in scrub typhus, and presentations with diffuse encephalopathy or a reversible sensorineural deafness are well documented. In contrast, focal neurological signs are rare. Cerebellar, brainstem and extrapyramidal manifestations have been reported, including opsoclonus, myoclonus and parkinsonian tremor. Further complications include myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS and renal failure. Immunity is short-lived and strain-specific.
