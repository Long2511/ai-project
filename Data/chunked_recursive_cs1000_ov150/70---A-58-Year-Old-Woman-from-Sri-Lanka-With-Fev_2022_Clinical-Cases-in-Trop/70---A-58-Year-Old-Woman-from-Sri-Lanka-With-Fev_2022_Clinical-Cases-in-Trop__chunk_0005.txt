Therefore doxycycline should be added to the empirical regimen to cover for O. tsutsugamushi infection. Doxycycline would also cover important differential diagnoses such as other rickettsial infections and leptospirosis.

Chloramphenicol or azithromycin is the accepted alternative treatment if tetracyclines are contraindicated, as is the case in pregnant women or patients with tetracycline hypersensitivity. Children at any age with scrub typhus can be safely treated with doxycycline.
