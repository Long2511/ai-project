Of note, acute hearing loss or hearing impairment in a febrile patient from Asia should always arouse strong suspicion of scrub typhus. However, no single clinical sign or laboratory test can rule in or rule out scrub typhus; therefore empirical antirickettsial treatment is given based on clinical and epidemiological evidence. A definitive laboratory diagnosis if at all possible in the particular setting can be established by demonstration of seroconversion in paired acute and convalescent serum samples or by PCR on pretreatment buffy coat samples of an eschar biopsy.
