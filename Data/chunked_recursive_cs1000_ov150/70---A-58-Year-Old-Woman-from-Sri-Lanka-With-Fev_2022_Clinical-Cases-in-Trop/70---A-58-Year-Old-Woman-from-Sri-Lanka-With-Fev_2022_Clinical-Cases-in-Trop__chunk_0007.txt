On day 2 after admission the patient developed coarse tremors of both upper and lower limbs associated with saccadic oscillations of her eyes in all directions with further deterioration of level of consciousness (GCS 8). At this point a careful clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated crater-like lesion in the right axilla hidden within the axillary folds. Doxycycline therapy was commenced and the patient improved over the next 48 hours. She was discharged on day 6 after admission. Her hearing had returned to normal and there were no other neurological deficits.

The patient's O. tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre came back high (>1:4096), supporting the suspected diagnosis of scrub typhus.

Scrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of Asia and northern Australia. Its epidemiology has long been considered limited to the Asia-Pacific area but in 2016 was also first described in patients from South America.
