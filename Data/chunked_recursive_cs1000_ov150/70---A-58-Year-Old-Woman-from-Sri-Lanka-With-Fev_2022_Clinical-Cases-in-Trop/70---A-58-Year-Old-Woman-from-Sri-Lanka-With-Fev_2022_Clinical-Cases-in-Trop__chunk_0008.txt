Scrub typhus belongs to the tropical rickettsial infections and is caused by O. tsutsugamushi. The infection is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite.

Infected mite larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats, from scrubs and primary forests to gardens, beaches, bamboo fields and oil palm or rubber estates. Reservoirs of O. tsutsugamushi are rodents and the mites themselves, which can maintain the infection by vertical transmission. Humans are accidental hosts.

The incubation period is 6 to 10 days. A painless papule occurs at the site of the bite, which later ulcerates and transforms into a black crust or 'eschar'. Patients present with fever, severe headache and myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy and, at times, a macular or maculopapular rash. Conjunctival suffusions, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as constipation can occur.
