Her basic laboratory results on admission revealed a normal white blood cell count and haemoglobin, but a low platelet count of 98 x 10⁹/L. Liver enzymes AST and ALT were elevated, while ALP and total bilirubin were normal. Renal function tests showed a high-normal blood urea nitrogen and elevated creatinine of 123.8 µmol/L. The C-reactive protein was significantly high at 48 mg/L. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated leukocyte count of 35 cells/µL, comprised of 80% lymphocytes, and an elevated protein level of 0.64 g/L. The CSF glucose was 3.25 mmol/L, which was low relative to the paired blood glucose of 7.17 mmol/L.

Her blood cultures grow no organisms; Leptospira and Salmonella serologies are negative. Leptospira-PCR is not available. A thick film for malaria parasites is negative as well.

Chest radiography does not show any pathological changes. Her ECG shows sinus tachycardia. The EEG reveals widespread slowing; the CT scan of the brain is normal.
