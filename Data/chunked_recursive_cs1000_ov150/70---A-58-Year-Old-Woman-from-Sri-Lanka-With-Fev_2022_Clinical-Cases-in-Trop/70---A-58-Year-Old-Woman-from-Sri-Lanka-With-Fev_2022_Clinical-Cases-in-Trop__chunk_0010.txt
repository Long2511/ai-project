Diagnosis can be challenging and, in many resource-limited settings, remains clinical. The diagnostic gold standard is the documentation of a significant rise in antibody titres in paired acute and convalescent serum samples. However, these serological tests are usually unavailable in resource-poor tropical areas. Despite controversies in sensitivity and specificity, immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests have been developed for field use and are being used in the diagnosis of scrub typhus in several endemic countries. ELISA-based tests have a high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-based tests have been developed and are mostly employed in genotypic characterization and for research purposes or as diagnostic tools in high-resource settings. Culture of O. tsutsugamushi from the blood takes several weeks and requires a biosafety level 3 facility.
