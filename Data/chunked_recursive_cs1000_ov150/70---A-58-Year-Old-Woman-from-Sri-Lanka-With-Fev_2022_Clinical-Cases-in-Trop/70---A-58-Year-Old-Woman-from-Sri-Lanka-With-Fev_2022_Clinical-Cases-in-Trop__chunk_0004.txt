Lymphadenopathy in the right axilla was detected on clinical examination of the patient. Her acute presentation with signs of severe sepsis make an infectious aetiology of the regional lymphadenopathy most likely. It is crucial to perform a meticulous examination in order to establish the port of entry of the microorganisms, which should be found in the skin area that drains to the enlarged regional lymph nodes.
In Asia, infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative pathogen of scrub typhus, is a common cause of fever, which is often associated with an eschar at the inoculation site and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes. However, the prevalence of eschar varies in different populations and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis of scrub typhus.

In Asia, scrub typhus must be considered in every patient presenting with an undifferentiated febrile illness, regardless of the presence or absence of an eschar.
