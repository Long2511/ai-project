Clinically, the flea together with the surrounding inflammatory reaction initially presents as a pale nodule with a dark centre; later the lesion might turn brown with a dark scab. It often causes local itching or pain. Symptoms are usually mild in patients visiting endemic areas and start after several days in cases of first infestation. Individuals living in endemic regions may suffer massive and repeated infestations leading to superinfection with complications such as gangrene, bacteraemia or tetanus.
