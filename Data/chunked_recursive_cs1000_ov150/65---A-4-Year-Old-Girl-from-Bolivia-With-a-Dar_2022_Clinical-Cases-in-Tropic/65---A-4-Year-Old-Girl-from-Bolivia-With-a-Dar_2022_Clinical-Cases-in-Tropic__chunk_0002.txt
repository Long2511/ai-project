The macroscopic presentation and localization of this lesion allows the clinical diagnosis of tungiasis. Physicians who are not familiar with the disease might send a sample for microscopic confirmation. The female flea is usually destroyed during the process of removal, but parts of the body as well as eggs can still be found.

The parasite should be completely removed using a sterile needle and/or curette. The resulting round lesion must be disinfected and dressed. The patient's tetanus vaccination status should be checked and the wound should be observed; and if necessary, treated for superinfection.

The skin lesion healed within a week without complications.
