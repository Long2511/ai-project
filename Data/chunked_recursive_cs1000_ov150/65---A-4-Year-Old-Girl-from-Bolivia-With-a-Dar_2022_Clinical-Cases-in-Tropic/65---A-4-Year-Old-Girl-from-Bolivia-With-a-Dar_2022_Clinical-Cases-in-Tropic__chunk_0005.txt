The parasite is endemic in Latin America from Mexico to northern Argentina and the Caribbean. From there it was introduced into sub-Saharan Africa, probably around 150 years ago. Tungiasis belongs to the category of neglected and poverty-related infectious disease. In poor communities of endemic countries, constant re-infection causes severe morbidity including deformation and permanent disability. Important zoonotic reservoirs for human infections include pigs, dogs and rats. In travellers, tungiasis is found in about 1% of those presenting with dermatological problems.

The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical presentation. In non-endemic regions, the parasite and its eggs may be demonstrated in tissue samples and histopathological sections. Treatment consists of removing the flea with a sterile needle or curette with or without local anaesthesia, disinfection and prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial infections.
