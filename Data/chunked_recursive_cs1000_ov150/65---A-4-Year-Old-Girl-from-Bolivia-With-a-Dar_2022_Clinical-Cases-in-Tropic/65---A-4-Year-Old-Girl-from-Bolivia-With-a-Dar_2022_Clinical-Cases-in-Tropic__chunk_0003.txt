The skin lesion healed within a week without complications.

Tungiasis is caused by the female Tunga penetrans (syn. sand flea, jigger, bicho do pé), which burrows into the epidermis of humans and various animals before oviposition. There, the parasite engorges to a size of approximately 1 cm, causing a slowly growing nodular skin lesion. The flea is completely embedded into the skin, except for the tip of the posterior end, through which the respiration, defecation and oviposition occurs.

Typical localizations are the periungual regions of the feet, interdigital spaces and soles. However, other parts of the body might be affected after contact with contaminated soil.
