The conventional dose of intramuscular artemether is 3.2 mg/kg STAT followed by 1.6 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. The patient probably received an actual dose of only approx-imately 1.0 mg/kg per day as monotherapy of inadequate duration. The combination of underdosing and poor-quality drug most likely resulted in his poor clinical response. He would presumably have recovered rapidly if oral artemether-lumefantrine had been given, as specified in the Lao national treatment guidelines.

This case emphasizes the importance of appropriate ther-apy and dosage, of following national guidelines and of checking the quality of a medicine taken if expected improvement does not occur.

Poor-quality medicines are of two main types - substandard and falsified drugs.
