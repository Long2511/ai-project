Giemsa smear was negative for malaria parasites but a rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2) was positive for Plasmodium falci-parum, consistent with recent falciparum malaria. Serum cre-atinine and glucose were normal. Further laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) was 301 U/L (reference <40 U/L), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) was 230 U/L (reference <37 U/L), and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) was 470 U/L (reference <120 U/L). Total bilirubin was 14 µmol/L (reference <14.5 µmol/L), but direct bilirubin was elevated at 6.4 µmol/L (reference <4.3 µmol/L).

A 30-year-old Chinese itinerant trader presents to a hospital in Laos with persistent fever after receiving a 5-day course of antimalarial treatment with artemether for falciparum malaria. His blood smear is negative, but his rapid diagnostic test is positive for P. falciparum.
