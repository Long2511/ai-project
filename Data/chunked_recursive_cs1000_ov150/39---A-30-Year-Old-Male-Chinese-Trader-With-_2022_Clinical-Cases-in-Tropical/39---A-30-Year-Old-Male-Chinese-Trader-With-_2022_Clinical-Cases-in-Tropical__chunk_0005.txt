In our case, examination of the vial and packaging of the suspect sample did not reveal any overt differences from gen-uine samples suggesting that it was not falsified. However, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the suspect sample demon-strated that it only contained 59 mg artemether (74% of that stated on the vial). Electrospray mass spectra demonstrated that suspect and genuine samples were identical in terms of their qualitative chemical composition, i.e. their "finger-prints", but differed in active ingredient content. The arte-mether was therefore substandard, containing inadequate amounts of artemether because of factory error or negligence or a good quality genuine product that deteriorated during storage and transport.
