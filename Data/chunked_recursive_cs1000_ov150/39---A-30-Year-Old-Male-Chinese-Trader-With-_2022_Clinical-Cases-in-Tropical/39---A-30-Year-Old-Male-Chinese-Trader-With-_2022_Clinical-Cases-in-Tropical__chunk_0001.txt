A 30-year-old male Chinese itinerant trader is referred to a hospital in Vientiane, Laos, with 7 days of fever, chills, head-ache and a dry cough. He developed slide-positive falciparum malaria whilst living in southern Laos and was treated with intravenous infusions and intramuscular artemether 80 mg for 5 days, which he had brought from China as standby ther-apy, but did not improve. The fever persisted, jaundice devel-oped and he was therefore transferred to the capital Vientiane.

On admission he was febrile (39.5°C, 103.1°F) with normal blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score, but had nausea, dry cough, moderate dehydration, chest pain and abdominal tenderness. His chest was clear and no hepatosplenomegaly was detected.
