Poor-quality medicines are of two main types - substandard and falsified drugs.

Substandard drugs are produced by authorized manufac-turers; but because of unintentional errors in production or neg-ligence, they fail to meet pharmaceutical standards. They often contain reduced amounts of active ingredients or their bioavail-ability is poor. Medicines may also leave the factory of good quality but deteriorate because of poor storage in the distribution chain. In contrast, falsified drugs are deliberately produced by criminals by fraud and often, but not always, contain none of the stated active ingredients.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a large epidemic of falsified oral artesunate throughout mainland South-east Asia and, most alarmingly, there are increasing reports of falsified and substandard artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in Africa. Some contain wrong active ingredients that may be toxic or engender resistance.
