Inspection of packaging, although difficult, is key in detecting falsified medicines.

Unexpectedly low-cost medications, unexpectedly poor patient outcomes, unexpected adverse events and differences in packaging from those that patients and pharmacists are used to should signal alerts that should be reported to national regulatory authorities and the WHO (at rapidalert@who.int). There are very few quality-assured laboratories in malaria-endemic countries for the packaging and chemical analysis of antimalarial quality, making the timely and affordable checking of medicine quality very difficult.
