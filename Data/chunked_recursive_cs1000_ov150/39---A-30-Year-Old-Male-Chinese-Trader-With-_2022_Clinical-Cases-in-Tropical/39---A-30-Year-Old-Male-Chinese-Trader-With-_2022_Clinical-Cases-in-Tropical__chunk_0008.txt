There have been false reports of antimalarial drug resistance in both Africa and Asia, which upon further investigation were shown to be because of poor medicine quality. The use of arte-misinin derivative combinations with subtherapeutic drug content (whether falsified or substandard) and prescriptions for inade-quate doses or duration raise concern that these factors may facilitate the spread of resistance to this vital class of antimalarials.

Inspection of packaging, although difficult, is key in detecting falsified medicines.
