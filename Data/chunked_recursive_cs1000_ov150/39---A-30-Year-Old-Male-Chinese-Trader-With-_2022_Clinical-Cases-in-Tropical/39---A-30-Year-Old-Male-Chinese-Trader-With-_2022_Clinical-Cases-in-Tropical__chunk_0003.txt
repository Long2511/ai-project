With falciparum malaria the patient is at risk of bacterial co-infection, especially with Salmonella species. He could have another common infectious disease contracted in Laos such as scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), leptospirosis, tuberculosis or dengue fever.

Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria has been described from southern Laos, Cambodia border, the Burma (Myanmar)/Thai border, Myanmar and southern Vietnam, manifested as prolonged parasite clearance times. Other pos-sibilities are that the artemether was given at the incorrect dose, was of poor quality or that there were issues with intes-tinal absorption of the medicine.

Repeat history, physical examination and investigations (such as blood culture and chest radiography) looking for other causes of infection, review of the antimalarial dosage received and likely efficacy and consider retreatment with a known, quality-assured antimalarial.
