Laboratory results on admission revealed several electrolyte and protein abnormalities. The patient's potassium was low at 2.8 mmol/L, with the reference range being 3.5-5 mmol/L. Similarly, sodium was low at 127 mmol/L (reference 136-145 mmol/L), and total calcium was low at 2.1 mmol/L (reference 2.25-2.63 mmol/L). The albumin level was significantly decreased at 23 g/L, well below the reference of 35-55 g/L. The haemoglobin was also low at 10.8 g/dL (reference 11.5-15.5 g/dL). The white blood cell count of 6.6 x 10⁹/L and platelet count of 350 x 10⁹/L were within their respective reference ranges of 3.8-11 and 150-350. However, the eosinophil count was elevated at 0.53 x 10⁹/L (reference <0.45 x 10⁹/L), and creatinine was high at 115 µmol/L (reference 53-106 µmol/L). D-xylose test shows evidence of malabsorption. On stool microscopy, numerous helminth ova are detected (Fig. 58.1).
