. larvae develop into adults within the intestinal mucosa without leaving the host. This leads to a gradual increase of both worm burden and severity of clinical manifestations. With its autoinfection cycle, the parasite is one of the few intestinal helminths causing chronic and life-threatening infections. Patients present with colicky abdominal pain and intermittent or chronic diarrhoea accompanied by anorexia, vomiting and dehydration. Without treatment, infection progresses to severe enteropathy with crypt atrophy and flattening of villi. Chronically infected patients suffer cachexia and pitting oedema of the lower limbs. Untreated, they may eventually die of severe protein loss, electrolyte imbalance and concomitant bacterial infections. Parasitological diagnosis relies on the demonstration of typical peanutshaped eggs in stool samples, which have protruding polar plugs on both ends and measure 36 to 42 × 20 μm
