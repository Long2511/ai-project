A 25-year-old woman from Bani Suwaif in Upper Egypt (115 km south of Cairo) presents to a hospital in Cairo complaining of severe diarrhoea for 2 months accompanied by weight loss of about 15 kg and amenorrhoea. The symptoms started with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain; later on, she suffered anorexia and vomiting. The diarrhoea is voluminous, not related to meals, and occurs both during the day and at night (five to ten times in 24 hours).
She received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs, without any improvement. During the last month she has developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.

The patient appears generally unwell; she is pale and has angular stomatitis. She is afebrile, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.
