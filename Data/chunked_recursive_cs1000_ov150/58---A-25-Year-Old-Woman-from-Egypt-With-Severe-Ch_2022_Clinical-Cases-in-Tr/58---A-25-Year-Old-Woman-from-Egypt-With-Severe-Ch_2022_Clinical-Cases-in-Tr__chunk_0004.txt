C. philippinensis is endemic in various East and South-east Asian countries such as The Philippines, Thailand, Laos, China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Furthermore, cases have been reported from Egypt, Iran and India. Sporadic cases may occur elsewhere. One indigenous case has been reported from Cuba and another patient acquired the infection most probably in Colombia. Capillariasis is transmitted through consumption of raw or undercooked fish.

The patient was admitted to hospital. Albendazole was initiated at a dose of 400mg bd and continued for 3 weeks. Oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes were given for resuscitation, and she received a high protein diet and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths (length 3–5mm) were found in more stool samples (Fig. 58.2). The patient’s general condition improved significantly within the first week and vomiting stopped. Diarrhoea subsided after 2 weeks of treatment.
