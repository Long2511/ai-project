Intestinal capillariasis is a zoonotic disease caused by C. philippinensis, a tiny nematode usually infecting fish-eating birds, which recently has been transferred to the genus Paracapillaria. Humans are accidentally infected when eating raw or undercooked small fresh- or brackish-water fish harbouring infective larval stages of the parasite. Adult parasites invade the wall of the small intestine and live partially embedded in the mucosa of jejunum and ileum. The unique life cycle includes an alteration of oviparous and larviparous females. Oviparous females shed thick-shelled eggs, which exit the body with the stool and, after being eaten by small fish, develop into the infective larvae. Larviparous females contain thin-shelled eggs, which mainly hatch in utero and permit an internal autoinfection and multiplication cycle, i.e. larvae develop into adults within the intestinal mucosa without leaving the host
