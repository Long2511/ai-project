A 25-year-old woman from Upper Egypt presents with severe chronic diarrhoea and colicky abdominal pain. She is afebrile but shows clinical signs of chronic malabsorption. Full blood count reveals mild eosinophilia, blood chemistry shows electrolyte derangement and hypoalbuminaemia. Stool samples yield peanut-shaped helminth eggs.

The peanut-shaped eggs spotted on stool microscopy are typical ova of Capillaria philippinensis. The patient’s complaints are very compatible with intestinal capillariasis, and she resides in an endemic area. In contrast to most other intestinal helminths, C. philippinensis is able to multiply within the intestine of its final host causing long-lasting infection and severe clinical manifestations.
