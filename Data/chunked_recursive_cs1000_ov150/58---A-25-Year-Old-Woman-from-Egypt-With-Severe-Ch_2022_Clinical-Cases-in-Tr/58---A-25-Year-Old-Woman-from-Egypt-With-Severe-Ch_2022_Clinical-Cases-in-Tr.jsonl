The symptoms started with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain; later on, she suffered anorexia and vomiting. The diarrhoea is voluminous, not related to meals, and occurs both during the day and at night (five to ten times in 24 hours).\nShe received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs, without any improvement. During the last month she has developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.\n\nThe patient appears generally unwell; she is pale and has angular stomatitis. She is afebrile, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor."}

The patient's potassium was low at 2.8 mmol/L, with the reference range being 3.5-5 mmol/L. Similarly, sodium was low at 127 mmol/L (reference 136-145 mmol/L), and total calcium was low at 2.1 mmol/L (reference 2.25-2.63 mmol/L). The albumin level was significantly decreased at 23 g/L, well below the reference of 35-55 g/L. The haemoglobin was also low at 10.8 g/dL (reference 11.5-15.5 g/dL). The white blood cell count of 6.6 x 10⁹/L and platelet count of 350 x 10⁹/L were within their respective reference ranges of 3.8-11 and 150-350. However, the eosinophil count was elevated at 0.53 x 10⁹/L (reference <0.45 x 10⁹/L), and creatinine was high at 115 µmol/L (reference 53-106 µmol/L). D-xylose test shows evidence of malabsorption. On stool microscopy, numerous helminth ova are detected (Fig. 58.1)."}

She is afebrile but shows clinical signs of chronic malabsorption. Full blood count reveals mild eosinophilia, blood chemistry shows electrolyte derangement and hypoalbuminaemia. Stool samples yield peanut-shaped helminth eggs.\n\nThe peanut-shaped eggs spotted on stool microscopy are typical ova of Capillaria philippinensis. The patient’s complaints are very compatible with intestinal capillariasis, and she resides in an endemic area. In contrast to most other intestinal helminths, C. philippinensis is able to multiply within the intestine of its final host causing long-lasting infection and severe clinical manifestations."}

Furthermore, cases have been reported from Egypt, Iran and India. Sporadic cases may occur elsewhere. One indigenous case has been reported from Cuba and another patient acquired the infection most probably in Colombia. Capillariasis is transmitted through consumption of raw or undercooked fish.\n\nThe patient was admitted to hospital. Albendazole was initiated at a dose of 400mg bd and continued for 3 weeks. Oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes were given for resuscitation, and she received a high protein diet and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths (length 3–5mm) were found in more stool samples (Fig. 58.2). The patient’s general condition improved significantly within the first week and vomiting stopped. Diarrhoea subsided after 2 weeks of treatment."}

Humans are accidentally infected when eating raw or undercooked small fresh- or brackish-water fish harbouring infective larval stages of the parasite. Adult parasites invade the wall of the small intestine and live partially embedded in the mucosa of jejunum and ileum. The unique life cycle includes an alteration of oviparous and larviparous females. Oviparous females shed thick-shelled eggs, which exit the body with the stool and, after being eaten by small fish, develop into the infective larvae. Larviparous females contain thin-shelled eggs, which mainly hatch in utero and permit an internal autoinfection and multiplication cycle, i.e. larvae develop into adults within the intestinal mucosa without leaving the host"}

This leads to a gradual increase of both worm burden and severity of clinical manifestations. With its autoinfection cycle, the parasite is one of the few intestinal helminths causing chronic and life-threatening infections. Patients present with colicky abdominal pain and intermittent or chronic diarrhoea accompanied by anorexia, vomiting and dehydration. Without treatment, infection progresses to severe enteropathy with crypt atrophy and flattening of villi. Chronically infected patients suffer cachexia and pitting oedema of the lower limbs. Untreated, they may eventually die of severe protein loss, electrolyte imbalance and concomitant bacterial infections. Parasitological diagnosis relies on the demonstration of typical peanutshaped eggs in stool samples, which have protruding polar plugs on both ends and measure 36 to 42 × 20 μm"}
