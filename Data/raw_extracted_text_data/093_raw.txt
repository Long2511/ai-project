93 A 35-Year-Old Male Logger from Peru With Fever, Jaundice and Bleeding PEDRO LEGUA Clinical Presentation TABLE Laboratory Results on Admission 93.1 History Parameter Result (Reference Range) A 35-year-old Peruvian man is referred to a hospital in Lima. Eight days prior, he developed fever and retro-orbital Haematocrit 30 % (41–53) headache. Two days into the illness he was admitted to a White cell count 8700 /μL (4500–11000) local hospital in the jungle after he had developed jaundice, Bands: 4 % (0–10) coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria and increasing Neutrophils: 62 % (40–70) Eosinophils: 0 % (0–8) mental obtundation. During the transfer to the referral Basophils: 0 % (0–3) hospital in Lima the patient had a generalized seizure.

In fatal cases, death usually occurs 7 to 10 days into the illness. Yellow fever causes an infection of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. There is mid-zonal hepatocellular necrosis with a minimal inflammatory response. Councilman bodies and microvesicular fatty changes are seen. The sudden and marked decrease of hepatic transaminases in our patient just before death likely represented near total destruction of functioning hepatocytes and acute hepatic disintegration. As with other flaviviruses there is no specific treatment for yellow fever, making prevention by use of the 17 D live yellow fever vaccine imperative. Vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent persons is at nearly 100 %. While most individuals in endemic areas (Amazon basin and sub-Saharan Africa) have poor access to vaccines and there are regular shortages during yellow fever epidemics there is dramatic under-use of the vaccination by travellers and expatriates. Data indicates that the number of unvaccinated travellers visiting risk areas is substantial. Each year, deaths in unvaccinated travellers to yellow fever endemic areas are reported.
