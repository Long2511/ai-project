  "differential_diagnosis": "Adenovirus infection: Can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis but these are normally mild. Measles: Presents with fever, cough, coryza and striking conjunctivitis. May also cause pneumonia but is rarely severe. Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Can cause a pharyngitis but is rarely severe. Other forms of pneumonia are possible but do not normally cause conjunctivitis. Leptospirosis: Starts with a non-specific febrile illness. Pulmonary involvement including haemorrhages is common and it can cause renal impairment. Patients with severe leptospirosis tend to present with conjunctival suffusions rather than with conjunctivitis. Typhoid: Presents as a non-specific febrile illness. You would expect the patient to eventually improve once ceftriaxone is given, but prolonged clinical courses in typhoid are not uncommon.",
