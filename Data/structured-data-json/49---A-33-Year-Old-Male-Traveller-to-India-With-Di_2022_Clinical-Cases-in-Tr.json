  "patient_information": "A 33-year-old man from Finland, measuring 180 cm and weighing 72 kg, who reports a 4 kg weight loss. No other significant medical history is mentioned.",
  "chief_complaint": "Passage of loose stools, four or five episodes per day, with flatulence for the past two weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For the past two weeks, the patient experienced four to five episodes of loose stools daily, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping on defecation. Over the last three days, he noted bloating, distension, and an urge to pass stool after consuming milk products. He had mild nausea but no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin that ended two days prior, they became mushy, greasy, foul-smelling, and occurred three to four times per day.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient had been backpacking in India for the month prior to seeking medical care in Chinglepet, Tamil Nadu. His symptoms are consistent with an infection acquired during travel in a region where giardiasis is common, typically transmitted via contaminated water or food.",
  "vitals": "The patient was afebrile. No other specific vital signs are documented, but the clinical findings state 'no signs of dehydration' and 'the rest of the examination is normal'.",
  "physical_exam": "Clinical findings included mild, non-specific abdominal tenderness. There were no signs of dehydration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Stool analysis was positive for reducing substances. Microscopic stool examination for enteric parasites was confirmatory, revealing Giardia trophozoites in the fresh specimen and Giardia cysts on formol-ether concentrated specimens.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The case text does not explicitly detail a differential diagnosis. The diagnosis was established directly from stool microscopy, which is confirmatory for giardiasis. The clinical picture of protracted, non-febrile, malabsorptive diarrhea in a traveler from an endemic region is highly suggestive of this etiology.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received a single 2g oral dose of tinidazole and was advised to restrict milk and high-sugar products for two weeks. He was also counseled on food and water safety. At a follow-up visit three days later, his stool consistency had normalized, frequency had decreased, and anorexia and nausea had resolved. He reported feeling much better, despite some transient bloating after inadvertently consuming a milk-based dessert.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the parasite Giardia intestinalis (G. lamblia). This was confirmed by the direct visualization of both Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and carbohydrate malabsorption (indicated by positive stool reducing substances) after travel in India is characteristic of the infection.",
  "disease_name_short": "Giardiasis"
