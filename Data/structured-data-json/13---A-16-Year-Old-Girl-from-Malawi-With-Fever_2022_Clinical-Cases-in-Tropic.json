  "patient_information": "A 16-year-old Malawian girl who delivered a baby 5 months prior. An HIV test performed during her antenatal care was negative. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She is in a fair nutritional state.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache for the past 5 days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, a 16-year-old girl, presented to a local hospital with a 5-day history of fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache. No other details on the progression of the illness are provided.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives with her parents, three siblings, and her baby in an urban, high-density area in Malawi. The household has no running water or electricity, and the family fetches water from a community tap. She recently dropped out of primary school during her pregnancy. Malawi is noted to be highly endemic for schistosomiasis.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, pulse was 78 bpm, and respiratory rate was 20 breath cycles per minute. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared in a fair nutritional state with mild scleral jaundice. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse tenderness without guarding. The liver was not enlarged, but the spleen was palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Chest and pelvic examinations were unremarkable, with no vaginal discharge.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, MCV of 90 fL, and platelets of 164 x 10^9/L. Creatinine was 71 µmol/L. A blood film for malaria parasites was positive with a parasite density described as 'low'. Liver function tests were not available. A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures subsequently grew Salmonella Typhi.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and enteric fever. Malaria could explain many symptoms, though the abdominal pain was noted as unusual, and low parasitemia is common in semi-immune individuals in endemic areas. Enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid) was considered due to the combination of abdominal tenderness, splenomegaly, frontal headache, and relative bradycardia. Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis were also considered possibilities.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Upon admission, the patient was started on oral artemether/lumefantrine and intravenous ceftriaxone 2g daily. After blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi, the antibiotic was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily. The patient's fever began to resolve on day 5 of antibiotic treatment, and she was discharged on day 7 to complete a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin. She was also given a single dose of praziquantel due to the high endemicity of schistosomiasis in Malawi, which can favor chronic carriage of S. Typhi.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Typhoid Fever caused by Salmonella Typhi. This was definitively confirmed by a positive blood culture. The clinical presentation of prolonged fever, abdominal pain, headache, splenomegaly, and relative bradycardia was highly consistent with enteric fever. The patient also had a concurrent malaria infection with low parasitemia, which was treated, but her sustained illness and response to ciprofloxacin pointed to typhoid as the primary diagnosis.",
