  "patient_information": "A 31-year-old HIV-positive man, diagnosed 6 years prior, who is not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. His CD4 count one month before presentation was 280/μL, and on admission was 150/µL. He denies recreational drug use and has never smoked tobacco, with no other significant past medical history.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath, dry cough, and drenching night sweats.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10 kg over the past 5 months. At presentation, he was short of breath at rest but able to complete full sentences.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in London and travels extensively for business, with work trips in the past 6 months to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. He lives with his male partner. No other specific exposures were mentioned.",
  "vitals": "On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation (sO2) of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of O2.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was alert but short of breath at rest. Auscultation of the chest was clear. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Arterial blood gas on ambient air showed respiratory failure with a PaO2 of 7.6 kPa. The full blood count, creatinine, urea, and liver function tests were normal. CRP was slightly elevated at 6.7 mg/dL. His CD4 count was 150/µL, and his HIV viral load was 1,500,000 copies/mL. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral perihilar infiltrates, and a chest CT showed extensive 'ground-glass' infiltrates with no pulmonary emboli. Serum β-D-glucan was >500 pg/mL. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with Grocott staining revealing Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms and a strongly positive PCR for P. jirovecii DNA.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Given the patient was ART-naïve and HIV-positive with a low CD4 count, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the leading differential. Other possibilities considered included tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis, particularly in light of his extensive travel. Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.",
