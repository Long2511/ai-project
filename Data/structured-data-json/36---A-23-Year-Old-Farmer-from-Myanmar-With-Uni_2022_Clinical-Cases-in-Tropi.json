{
  "patient_information": "The patient is a 23-year-old farmer from Myanmar. He is described as being in fair general condition with no other significant medical history, comorbidities, or immunosuppression reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 3-year history of left-sided scrotal swelling.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 23-year-old farmer presented with a left-sided scrotal swelling that had been gradually increasing in size over three years. The swelling was described as non-tender, and there was no history of fever. He had previously attempted treatment with traditional herbal medicine without any improvement.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a farmer from the central part of Myanmar. He reported that scrotal swelling is a common problem in his home region, suggesting a possible endemic infectious cause. The text notes that lymphatic filariasis is endemic in Southeast Asia, but urogenital schistosomiasis is not.",
  "vitals": "His vital signs are reported as normal and he is afebrile.",
  "physical_exam": "On examination, there was a massive unilateral scrotal swelling which was non-tender and could not be manually reduced. There were no palpable inguinal lymph nodes.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "An ultrasound of the scrotum was performed and confirmed a hydrocoele. The text discusses other potential investigations for lymphatic filariasis, such as looking for the 'filarial dance sign' on ultrasound or using circulating filarial antigen (CFA) tests, but it does not state these were performed on this patient.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for a chronic, non-tender scrotal swelling included inguinal hernia, hydrocoele, and testicular tumour. Given the patient's report of similar cases in his region, an infectious etiology was strongly considered, with lymphatic filariasis (LF) being the most likely cause as hydrocoele is its most common manifestation. Urogenital schistosomiasis was considered less likely due to geographic location, and testicular tuberculosis was deemed improbable given the long duration without other systemic signs or symptoms.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was managed with a hydrocoelectomy, during which 3 litres of clear fluid were drained. He also received antifilarial treatment. He lived in a remote area and was lost to follow-up after the procedures.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is lymphatic filariasis presenting as a chronic hydrocoele. This is based on the clinical finding of a massive, non-tender, non-reducible scrotal swelling, which was confirmed to be a hydrocoele on ultrasound. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's epidemiology as a farmer from an endemic region in Myanmar where such conditions are common, and the administration of specific antifilarial treatment alongside surgery.",
  "disease_name_short": "Lymphatic Filariasis"
