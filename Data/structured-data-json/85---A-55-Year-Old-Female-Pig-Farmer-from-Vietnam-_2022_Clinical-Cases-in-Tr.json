  "patient_information": "A 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, for which she has been on treatment for 4 years. She is a pig farmer and works as a butcher in a local market, selling pork and chicken.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 1-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting, followed by impaired consciousness.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented to a hospital in rural Vietnam with a one-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. An initial blood film for malaria was negative. On the second day of her illness, she developed confusion and was subsequently referred to a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City for further investigation and management.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in rural Vietnam. She has direct occupational exposure to pigs and pork, as she raises pigs on her smallholding and works as a butcher in a local market.",
  "vitals": "On admission to the referral hospital, she had a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F), tachycardia at 124 bpm, hypotension of 85/60 mmHg, and tachypnoea at 32 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 86% on ambient air, and her Glasgow Coma Score was 12/15 (E3 M5 V4).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was confused with neck stiffness and photophobia, but had no focal neurological signs. Skin examination revealed a diffuse petechial rash over her trunk and marked purpuric non-blanching lesions on her left leg. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial labs on admission showed leukocytosis (10.25 x 10^9/L) with 86.5% neutrophils, severe thrombocytopenia (56 x 10^9/L), hyperglycemia (15.4 mmol/L), and a high lactate (11.2 mmol/L). A non-contrast brain CT, chest x-ray, and ECG were unremarkable aside from sinus tachycardia. Lumbar puncture revealed turbid cerebrospinal fluid with 2870 cells/µL (92% neutrophils), elevated protein (541.16 mg/dL), and a very low CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.12. The CSF Gram stain showed a Gram-positive coccus in short chains. Repeat malaria films, RDTs, India ink, mycobacterial GeneXpert, and Herpes simplex virus PCR were all negative. Five days later, both blood and CSF cultures grew Streptococcus suis, which was sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis included severe malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and acute bacterial meningitis. Malaria was considered due to the endemic location but ruled out by negative tests. The rapid progression made enteric fever less likely. The presentation with shock and meningitis signs was not typical for dengue. The most probable diagnosis was acute bacterial meningitis with septic shock. Given the Vietnamese setting and the patient's exposure to pigs, Streptococcus suis was the most likely causative agent, over more globally common pathogens like S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received initial treatment with fluids and paracetamol. At the referral hospital, she was started on empirical intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin, along with supportive care. Dexamethasone was administered for the first 4 days of treatment. She completed a 12-day course of antibiotics. The patient responded to treatment but suffered a complication of residual bilateral hearing impairment.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis complicated by septic shock. This was confirmed by the isolation of S. suis from both blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The clinical presentation of acute meningitis, shock, and a purpuric rash, along with the patient's clear occupational exposure to pigs, was highly suggestive. The diagnosis was further supported by classic CSF findings of bacterial meningitis, including a high neutrophil count and a very low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio.",
  "disease_name_short": "Streptococcus suis meningitis"
