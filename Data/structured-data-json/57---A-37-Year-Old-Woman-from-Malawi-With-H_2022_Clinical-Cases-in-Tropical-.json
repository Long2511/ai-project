  "patient_information": "A 37-year-old woman from Malawi with an unremarkable past medical history. She does not take regular painkillers or drink alcohol. An HIV test conducted 3 months prior was negative.",
  "chief_complaint": "Three episodes of vomiting bright red blood over the past 24 hours.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a first episode of haematemesis, having vomited bright red blood three times in the last 24 hours. She reported no epigastric pain, no previous history of vomiting, no fever, and no other abnormal bleeding. Her stool was normal in colour. Prior to symptom onset, she was well.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives and works on a large sugar plantation in the Lower Shire Valley of southern Malawi, a region described as highly endemic for schistosomiasis where water bodies are infested with Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium.",
  "vitals": "On admission, she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, a pulse of 110 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, consistent with shock.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was slim, afebrile, and slightly pale but not jaundiced. Abdominal examination revealed a non-tender abdomen with no distension, a palpable spleen 10 cm below the left costal margin, and a slightly enlarged liver. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease, shifting dullness, peripheral oedema, or enlarged lymph nodes.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed pancytopenia with normocytic anaemia: WBC 2.8 x 10^9/L, haemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, MCV 88 fL, and platelets 130 x 10^9/L. Subsequent investigations included an endoscopy which confirmed the presence of oesophageal varices as the source of bleeding. Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. A single stool sample for S. mansoni ova was negative. An ultrasound of the liver described a pattern typical of 'pipestem fibrosis'.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices due to portal hypertension, strongly suggested by the combination of splenomegaly and pancytopenia in a patient from a schistosomiasis-endemic area. Other causes of GI bleeding like peptic ulcer disease or erosive gastritis were considered less likely as they would not explain the splenomegaly. Visceral leishmaniasis was also considered but deemed less probable due to the absence of fever and its rarity in Southern Africa.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was managed with IV fluids and transferred to a central hospital for an endoscopy, where variceal banding was performed. After confirming the likely diagnosis, she received a single dose of praziquantel 40 mg/kg and was subsequently discharged home.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is hepatosplenic schistosomiasis causing portal hypertension and bleeding oesophageal varices. This conclusion is based on the patient's classic presentation of haematemesis with marked splenomegaly and pancytopenia, her long-term exposure in a highly endemic region of Malawi, and the exclusion of other common causes like chronic viral hepatitis. The diagnosis was further solidified by ultrasound findings of 'pipestem fibrosis', a pathognomonic sign of hepatic schistosomiasis, and endoscopic confirmation of varices as the bleeding source.",
