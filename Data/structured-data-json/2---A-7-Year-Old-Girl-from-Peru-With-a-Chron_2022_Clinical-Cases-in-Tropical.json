  "patient_information": "A 7-year-old girl residing in Lima, Peru, who is described as otherwise healthy.",
  "chief_complaint": "A chronic skin lesion on the nose, present for 4 months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The lesion began 4 months prior as a small nodule on the nose that slowly evolved into an ulcer. It is described as being slightly itchy but not painful. There was no history of trauma to the area.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in Lima, Peru. Six months prior to presentation, she travelled to a valley on the western slopes of the Andes. The patient lives in a poor neighborhood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, though she did not travel to a region known to be hyperendemic for sporotrichosis.",
  "vitals": "The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs are reported.",
  "physical_exam": "A localized ulcer is present on the nose, measuring about 2 cm in diameter. The ulcer has indurated borders with plaque-like infiltration of the surrounding skin. Upon removal of a scab, the ulcer base was revealed to have a cobblestone-patterned bottom and raised edges. There are no palpable lymph nodes, and the rest of the physical examination is normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Microscopic examination of a scraping from the lesion was negative for amastigotes. However, the leishmanin skin test was positive. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was also positive, and identified the infecting species as Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. Common bacterial infections, cutaneous anthrax, and tularemia were considered less likely due to the chronic nature, location, and lack of associated symptoms like edema. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was considered the most likely diagnosis due to the frequency of the disease in the valley the patient travelled to and the characteristic presentation of a localized, painless ulcer with raised edges.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with intravenous sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 20 days. She also received topical imiquimod therapy every other day for 20 days. The response to treatment was good, and at a three-month follow-up, she showed no signs of relapse.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana. This was definitively confirmed by a positive leishmanin skin test and a positive PCR test which identified the specific species. The clinical presentation of a chronic, painless ulcer with raised edges on the nose following travel to an endemic area in the Andes is characteristic of this disease.",
  "disease_name_short": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis"
