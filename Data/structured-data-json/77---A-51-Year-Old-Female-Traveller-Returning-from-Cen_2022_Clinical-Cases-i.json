  "patient_information": "A 51-year-old female Swiss traveller with no reported chronic underlying diseases and not taking any medication.",
  "chief_complaint": "Presentation with a generalized rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral edema for two days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Four days after returning from her trip, the patient developed a generalized, slightly pruritic maculopapular rash on her face, trunk, and extremities. There was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. The following day, the rash worsened and she developed non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. She presented to the outpatient department six days after her return.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting to medical care 6 days after her return. The incubation period is consistent with an arboviral infection acquired in Central America.",
  "vitals": "The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed non-purulent conjunctivitis and a generalized maculopapular rash that also involved the face. Additionally, there was tender edema of the hands, elbows, knees, and feet, along with generalized lymphadenopathy affecting the cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory tests showed a normal full blood count and liver function tests. CRP was slightly elevated at 8 mg/L and creatinine was very mildly elevated at 87 µmol/L. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and chikungunya were negative. Subsequent testing at a reference laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection by a positive RT-PCR on an initial blood sample. Paired serology showed seroconversion, with a Zika IgM titer of 1:640 and a significant rise in Zika IgG from 1:20 to 1:5120. A rise in Dengue IgG was also noted but interpreted as cross-reactivity.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The clinical presentation was considered highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The primary differential diagnoses included the three most important arboviruses in Central and South America: dengue, chikungunya, and zika. Although they can have similar presentations, the combination of a skin rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral edema in an afebrile patient was considered highly indicative of a Zika virus infection.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The case notes that arboviral infections are self-limiting and management is exclusively supportive, as there are no specific treatment options. The specific supportive care provided to this patient and her clinical outcome were not detailed.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Acute Zika virus infection was diagnosed. The confirmation was based on a positive Zika virus RT-PCR from a blood sample taken 6 days after symptom onset. The diagnosis was further supported by seroconversion in paired serum samples, which demonstrated a positive Zika IgM and a significant rise in Zika IgG titer. Dengue and chikungunya were ruled out by negative tests, and the rise in Dengue IgG was attributed to serological cross-reactivity common among flaviviruses.",
  "disease_name_short": "Zika virus infection"
