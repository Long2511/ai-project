  "patient_information": "A 30-year-old woman, born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with no relevant past medical history and taking no medications. She presented to a clinic in Spain 4 months after arriving in Europe and expressed a wish to become pregnant.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 2-year history of progressive dyspnoea on moderate exertion and self-limiting palpitations.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reported a two-year history of progressive dyspnoea at moderate exertion (New York Heart Association grade II) accompanied by self-limiting palpitations. The presentation was notable for the absence of clinical signs of heart failure.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient was born in Bolivia and grew up in a rural area during her childhood, a known risk factor for Chagas disease. She had been living in an urban environment for the past 20 years and had arrived in Europe 4 months prior to her presentation. Her origin from a highly endemic country prompted screening for Chagas disease.",
  "vitals": "On examination, her blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg, her pulse was regular at 40 beats per minute, and her SpO2 was 99% on ambient air.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination was unremarkable. Cardiac auscultation revealed clear sounds with no murmurs, the chest was clear, and there was no peripheral oedema or raised jugular venous pressure.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count and basic blood chemistry were normal. Serological testing for Chagas disease was positive on two different assays detecting IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi. An ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a right bundle branch block. A chest radiograph demonstrated a moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiomegaly). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophic left ventricle without obstruction.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "For a recent migrant from Bolivia, the initial differential screening panel included active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and strongyloidiasis. However, Chagas disease was the primary consideration due to the patient's specific origin, the high prevalence in that region, and the clinical findings of bradycardia and conduction abnormalities, which are characteristic of chagasic cardiomyopathy.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was diagnosed with chagasic cardiomyopathy and started on antitrypanosomal therapy with benznidazole (5 mg/kg per day) for 60 days, given her intent to become pregnant. Fifteen days into the course, she developed a pruritic maculopapular rash and mild eosinophilia, which resolved after temporary discontinuation of benznidazole and a 5-day course of corticosteroids and antihistamines. Benznidazole was successfully re-introduced, and she completed the full 60-day treatment. At a 5-year follow-up, her cardiac function was stable, and she had given birth to a healthy child.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is chronic Chagas disease with chagasic cardiomyopathy, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Confirmation was based on positive results from two different serological tests for IgG antibodies. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's epidemiological history of growing up in a rural endemic area (Bolivia) and clinical evidence of cardiac involvement, including sinus bradycardia, right bundle branch block on ECG, cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, and a hypertrophic left ventricle on echocardiogram.",
