  "patient_information": "The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman who lives in a crowded back room within a remote community. Her family noted she had become increasingly withdrawn and was not leaving the house.",
  "chief_complaint": "Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.",
