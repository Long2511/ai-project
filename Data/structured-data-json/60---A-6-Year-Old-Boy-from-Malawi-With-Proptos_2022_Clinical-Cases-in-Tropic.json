  "patient_information": "A 6-year-old Malawian boy. On examination, he is described as thin but not malnourished.",
  "chief_complaint": "Painless, progressive proptosis of the left eye for 3 weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a painless, proptosed left eye, which was first noticed by his family 3 weeks prior to presentation. The condition had worsened rapidly, though his vision remained normal and he denied any pain.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The boy is from the lakeshore of Lake Malawi and resides in an area endemic for malaria and schistosomiasis. Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common childhood cancer in areas where malaria is holoendemic and is causally associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and malaria.",
  "vitals": "On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "The right eye was normal. The left eye was proptosed but non-pulsating. The left pupil was round, clear, and responded well to light, but the left eyeball hardly moved when asked to follow an object. No other swellings or abnormalities were noted.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "An urgent full work-up included a fine-needle aspirate (FNA), bone marrow aspirate (BMA), full blood count (FBC), lumbar puncture (LP), HIV antibody test, stool and urine microscopy, and an abdominal scan. Histology from the aspirate confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma, showing monomorphic tumour cells of intermediate size with coarse chromatin and cytoplasmic vacuoles. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample was examined for malignant cells. A blood film, stool, and urine samples were planned to rule out malaria or other parasitic infections like schistosomiasis or strongyloidiasis before treatment.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The most likely diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma, given the patient's age, rapid proptosis, and residence in a malaria-endemic area. Other possibilities considered included another type of B-cell lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Retinoblastoma was considered less likely due to the patient's age. Infection was excluded because the process was painless, and an arteriovenous malformation was unlikely as the mass was non-pulsating.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted for urgent workup and treatment to prevent irreversible eye damage. Prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone were administered during the lumbar puncture. Oral allopurinol and hyperhydration were started, followed by chemotherapy the next day. The proptosis began to resolve within 48 hours and the eye was back to normal within a week. He completed four courses of chemotherapy over 30 days. One year later, he was reported to be free of disease and cured.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. This was based on the patient's demographic (a 6-year-old boy from a malaria-endemic region in Malawi), the classic clinical presentation of a rapidly progressive, painless orbital proptosis, and was confirmed by histology from a fine-needle aspirate. The diagnosis was further supported by the rapid and complete clinical response to chemotherapy. The condition is known to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus and malaria.",
