  "patient_information": "A 72-year-old male farmer from northern Laos. No underlying comorbidities or immunosuppression were reported. Liver function tests and serum glucose remained normal during treatment.",
  "chief_complaint": "Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on the left foot and lower leg, with acute swelling and pain for three days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The condition began ten years prior, following a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week after the bite, a small painless red nodule developed at the site. Over the subsequent years, the lesion slowly enlarged, and further cauliflower-like and plaque-like lesions developed, spreading up to his knee. Three days before admission, his ankle became acutely painful and swollen, prompting him to seek care.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a farmer residing in northern Laos. The initial lesion developed at the site of a leech bite ten years ago, suggesting traumatic inoculation in an agricultural setting. The causative agents for this condition are typically found in plant debris or forest detritus, and male agricultural workers are the most commonly affected demographic.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs were reported as normal, and the patient was afebrile upon admission.",
  "physical_exam": "The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and hot skin. There were multiple cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were described as partly erythematous, partly fungating, and purulent, with a bad odour.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Bacterial culture of pus from the lesions grew Escherichia coli. Direct microscopic investigation of wet film skin scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis, which were made more visible with 10% potassium hydroxide solution. PCR from skin tissue was positive, and sequencing showed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for chronic verrucous skin lesions included fungal infections like sporotrichosis and mycetoma, as well as mycobacterial infections such as cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and Kaposi's Sarcoma were also considered. Non-infectious causes like squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis were possibilities. The acute signs of pain, swelling, and purulence suggested a secondary bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "A secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and treated with local iodine-based antiseptics and initial oral antibiotics (cloxacillin and metronidazole), which were later changed to co-trimoxazole based on culture sensitivities. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days, monthly pulse therapy) along with surgical debridement. Later, oral terbinafine (500-750 mg/d for 9 months) and local terbinafine ointment were added. The lesions healed uneventfully, leaving some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection. This was confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of brownish, round, multiseptate sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies') on direct microscopy of skin scrapings. The causative agent was identified by PCR and sequencing as Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, F. nubica). The clinical presentation of slowly progressive verrucous lesions on a lower limb following minor trauma in a farmer is classic for this disease. The patient also had a secondary bacterial superinfection with E. coli, which was successfully treated.",
