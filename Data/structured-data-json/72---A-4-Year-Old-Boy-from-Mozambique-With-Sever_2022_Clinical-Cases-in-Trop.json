  "patient_information": "An oedematous, HIV-negative 4-year-old boy from rural Mozambique. Three weeks prior to presentation at the central hospital, he had been treated for pneumonia at a health centre.",
  "chief_complaint": "Severe oedema and skin lesions, persistent for at least 5 days despite treatment.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The boy was admitted to a central hospital in Malawi five days earlier with a suspected diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. He was started on furosemide and prednisolone, however, his oedema did not subside. The onset of his current condition followed a treatment for pneumonia three weeks prior.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from rural Mozambique. The discussion notes that kwashiorkor, the likely diagnosis, typically occurs in areas where people live on a monotonous, low-protein diet such as maize or cassava, and that infections often precede the onset of the disease.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "The child was described as miserable, apathetic, and refusing to eat, with a puffy face and pitting oedema on the lower legs. His hair was brittle, sparse, and fair in colour. The skin was dry, hyperpigmented, and peeling off like 'flaky paint'. There were also ulcerative skin lesions, most prominently in the groins.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results revealed hypoalbuminemia with a serum albumin of 2.2 g/dL (reference range 3.0–5.2 g/dL) and anaemia with a haemoglobin of 7 g/dL (reference 12-14g/dL). A urine dipstick test was noted as a key differentiator from nephrotic syndrome, as proteinuria in kwashiorkor rarely exceeds 1+, unlike the heavy proteinuria (4+) of nephrotic syndrome.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis was nephrotic syndrome, which was the initial suspected diagnosis upon admission. However, this was distinguished from the final diagnosis of kwashiorkor based on the presence of additional signs of malnutrition (skin and hair changes, apathy) and the expected low level of proteinuria, which contrasts with the heavy proteinuria characteristic of nephrotic syndrome.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initial treatment with furosemide and prednisolone was ineffective. The child was then admitted to a nutrition rehabilitation unit and treated per WHO guidelines for severe acute malnutrition. He initially required feeding through a nasogastric tube. Superinfected skin lesions were treated with Gentian violet solution. By day 5, he began eating on his own and the oedema started to settle. He tolerated the transition to higher caloric feeds and was discharged to a community feeding program on day 15.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is kwashiorkor, a form of severe acute malnutrition. This was established based on the clinical presentation of oedema, hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), and characteristic dermatological signs including 'flaky paint' skin and brittle, discolored hair. The lack of response to diuretics and the clinical context distinguished it from nephrotic syndrome.",
