  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old Peruvian man, born in Lima, with a past medical history of hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years prior. He has not received any vaccinations since early childhood and has not taken any malaria prophylaxis.",
  "chief_complaint": "Referred from a local hospital for fever, jaundice, bleeding, and altered mental status, eight days after symptom onset.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient developed fever and retro-orbital headache eight days before referral. Two days into the illness, his condition worsened with the onset of jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria, and increasing mental obtundation, leading to admission at a local jungle hospital. During his transfer to the referral hospital in Lima, he experienced a generalized seizure.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "For the past five years, the patient has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River, which forms the Amazon River. This occupation in an endemic region of Peru exposed him to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. He was unvaccinated against relevant regional diseases.",
  "vitals": "On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands, and intermittently stuporous with marked flapping of hands (asterixis). He was jaundiced, with spontaneous bleeding from his oral mucosa and at IV sites, and had multiple large ecchymoses on his face, trunk, and limbs. Lung auscultation revealed crepitant rales in both bases. The liver was enlarged and felt 3 cm below the right costal margin, but the spleen was not palpable and there was no lymphadenopathy. There were no focal neurological or meningeal signs.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed anaemia (haematocrit 30%), mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 110,000/μL), and a normal white cell count. There was severe hepatocellular injury with AST 2890 U/L and ALT 2676 U/L, cholestasis with total bilirubin 11.6 mg/dL, and coagulopathy with an INR of 2.6 and aPTT of 80s. Acute kidney injury was present (Urea 89 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 50-60 RBCs/field. Malaria thick films (x3), blood cultures, Brucella serology, and Hepatitis B IgM anti-HBc were all negative. IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever was highly positive (1:10000), while anti-dengue IgM was negative. A chest x-ray later showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Subsequent labs showed worsening renal failure and a sudden drop in liver transaminases.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for this acute febrile illness with liver failure included severe malaria, though transaminases were atypically high. Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and toxic hepatitis were considered. Leptospirosis was less likely due to the extreme elevation of transaminases. Typhoid and brucellosis were also possibilities. Severe dengue was considered, but the prolonged fever, prominent jaundice, and low haematocrit made it less probable. Given his occupation and lack of vaccination in an endemic area, yellow fever was a primary concern among other viral haemorrhagic fevers.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received supportive care along with presumptive treatment for malaria and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite this, his condition rapidly deteriorated over the next three days with worsening hepatic encephalopathy, progressive renal failure, coma, and DIC with increased spontaneous bleeding. He developed ARDS. Laboratory results showed worsening kidney function and a sudden drop in liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatic disintegration. The patient passed away one day later, on the fourth day of admission to the Lima hospital.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is severe, fatal yellow fever. This was confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever with a titer of 1:10000. The clinical presentation of fever, jaundice, bleeding, and multi-organ failure (liver, kidney, lungs) in an unvaccinated logger working in an endemic region of the Peruvian Amazon is classic for the disease. Other considerations like malaria, dengue, and bacterial sepsis were less likely given the clinical picture and negative diagnostic tests. The terminal drop in transaminases was consistent with near-total destruction of hepatocytes.",
