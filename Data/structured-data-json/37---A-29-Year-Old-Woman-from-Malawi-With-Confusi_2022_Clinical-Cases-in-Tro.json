  "patient_information": "A 29-year-old woman from Malawi. Her past medical history has been uneventful, with no previous psychiatric disorders. Her HIV status is unknown at presentation. She is not taking any medication and has no known use of alcohol, recreational drugs, or other intoxications. She is a housewife, married with four children.",
  "chief_complaint": "Confusion, diarrhoea, and a skin rash.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was brought to the hospital after being confused, restless, and irritable for the past month. She developed watery diarrhoea one week prior to presentation. She does not have a fever. Relatives report that the skin rash has been present for the past two months.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in Malawi, presenting in January, which is the rainy season and is also known as the 'hungry season'. She lives in a grass-thatched mud-hut, collects water from a borehole, and has no electricity. Her diet consists of two meals a day, mainly maize porridge with a few vegetables, and only rarely includes fish or meat. Her husband works as a farmhand on a local chicken farm.",
  "vitals": "The patient is afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15, indicating confusion. The remaining vital signs are reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient is slim but not wasted, with pale conjunctivae and no neck stiffness. There is a noticeable, clearly demarcated skin rash on sun-exposed areas including around the neck, on her forearms, hands, and feet. The skin in these areas appears hyperpigmented and dry. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "An HIV test came back negative. The full blood count showed a microcytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL and a Mentzer index greater than 13.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary suspected diagnosis was pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) due to the clinical triad of neuropsychiatric changes, watery diarrhoea, and a photosensitive dermatitis. Other differential diagnoses considered included conditions associated with HIV infection, such as tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), given the clinical presentation in a sub-Saharan African setting. Systemic lupus erythematosus was also considered due to the combination of photosensitive dermatitis, anaemia, and neuropsychiatric changes.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received an appropriate dose of vitamin B-complex, iron, and folic acid supplementation, along with a single dose of albendazole. Her confusion settled within a week, and the diarrhoea stopped. She and her family received dietary counselling. She was prescribed soothing applications for her skin lesions and advised to avoid sun exposure. She was discharged and asked to return for an outpatient follow-up in 3 months.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is pellagra, a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin) or its precursor, tryptophan. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation with the 'three Ds': dermatitis (a photosensitive, hyperpigmented rash), diarrhoea (watery), and dementia (confusion). This was supported by her poor, maize-based diet, a negative HIV test that ruled out common mimics, and a rapid clinical response to vitamin supplementation. Co-existing iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed based on microcytic anemia with a Mentzer index >13.",
