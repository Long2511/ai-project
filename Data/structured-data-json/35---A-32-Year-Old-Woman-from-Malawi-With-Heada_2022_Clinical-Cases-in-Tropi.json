  "patient_information": "A 32-year-old Malawian woman who appeared wasted and slightly anaemic. She was newly diagnosed with HIV, with a CD4 count of 22/µL, indicating severe immunosuppression. No history of head trauma was reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 3-week history of headache and blurred vision.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a gradual onset headache over three weeks that did not respond to over-the-counter painkillers, accompanied by blurred vision. She reported no fever or convulsions. Prior to admission, she had presented to a local health centre where she received presumptive antimalarial treatment (artemether/lumefantrine) and a course of amoxicillin (500 mg tds for 5 days), both of which provided no benefit.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Malawi, a region with a high HIV prevalence. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures were detailed.",
  "vitals": "On admission, all vital signs were normal and the patient was afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was markedly increased at 50 cmH2O (normal: 10-18 cmH2O).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was wasted and slightly anaemic with a normal GCS of 15/15 and no neck stiffness. Visual acuity was normal bilaterally. Examination revealed an abduction deficit of the left eye on left lateral gaze, consistent with an abducens nerve palsy, which she described as 'blurring of vision'. The rest of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.7x10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL with a normal MCV (92 fL), and platelets of 91x10⁹/L, indicating leukopenia, normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. A Malaria RDT was negative. HIV serology was positive with a CD4 count of 22/µL. A lumbar puncture revealed clear CSF with an opening pressure of 50 cmH2O. CSF analysis showed 18 leukocytes/µL, elevated protein at 0.8 g/L, and low glucose at 1.97 mmol/L. The India Ink stain was negative, but the CSF culture grew Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing was not available.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis was chronic meningitis, with cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculous meningitis being the most important considerations. Partially treated bacterial meningitis was considered less likely due to the gradual onset of symptoms. Malaria was deemed an unlikely diagnosis due to the absence of fever, a negative RDT, prior antimalarial treatment, and the presence of a cranial nerve palsy, which is not typical for malaria.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was started on oral fluconazole 1200 mg for cryptococcal meningitis, as amphotericin B and flucytosine were unavailable. She also received co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and underwent repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures for headache relief. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks into her antifungal treatment. Despite this management, the patient returned to her village and died 6 weeks later of an unknown cause.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans in the setting of advanced, untreated HIV infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive CSF culture for C. neoformans. Clinical evidence included a subacute headache, abducens nerve palsy, and markedly elevated intracranial pressure, all classic features of the disease in a severely immunocompromised individual (CD4 count 22/µL). The negative India Ink stain was noted but is known to have limited sensitivity.",
