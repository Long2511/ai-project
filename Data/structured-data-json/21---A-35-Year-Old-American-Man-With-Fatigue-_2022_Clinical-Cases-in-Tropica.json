  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old Caucasian male with an unremarkable past medical history. He works as a postal worker and has had no foreign travel within the previous year or contact with animals.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fatigue and a neck lesion that started as a papule two days prior.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a rash on his neck that began as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before its onset while shaving. He had been seen in a clinic 24 hours prior and was discharged on an oral cephalosporin, but returned due to worsening malaise, neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a postal worker in the United States with no recent foreign travel, contact with animals, or known insect bites. The case occurred during an investigation into a bioterrorism event, and his exposure was later determined to be from handling contaminated mail during his occupation.",
  "vitals": "On examination, his temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His neck circumference had increased from a baseline of 57 cm to a peak of 81 cm.",
  "physical_exam": "Examination revealed a 2 cm irregularly shaped, indurated, non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema which made lymph node assessment difficult. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, were normal except for a mildly elevated hemoglobin at 18.7 g/dL. Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. A subsequent Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion were negative for B. anthracis. However, a skin biopsy sent to a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed the presence of B. anthracis antigens. Convalescent serology revealed the presence of antibodies to protective antigen.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for an ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. Given the ongoing bioterrorism investigation in the United States at the time, cutaneous anthrax was the most important diagnosis to consider, supported by the presence of a painless papule evolving into an ulcer with extensive, non-tender edema and systemic symptoms without significant fever.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially treated with a first-generation cephalosporin but his condition worsened. Upon his return to the clinic, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam. Following this treatment regimen, the patient recovered.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a skin biopsy which showed abundant B. anthracis antigens, and by serology showing antibodies to protective antigen in convalescent serum. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's clinical picture of a painless ulcer with massive edema and his occupational exposure as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a known bioterrorism event.",
