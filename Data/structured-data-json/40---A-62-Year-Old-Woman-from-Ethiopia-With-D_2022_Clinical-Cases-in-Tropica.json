  "patient_information": "A 62-year-old woman from rural Ethiopia, described as normally fit, well, and very physically active from her work on a smallholding. Her age and origin made it likely that she had not received tetanus vaccination.",
  "chief_complaint": "Difficulty chewing, described as 'stiffness of the mouth', which began three days after arriving in Europe.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Three days after arriving in Europe, the patient developed difficulty chewing, described as 'stiffness of the mouth'. This had never happened before. Two days after this initial presentation, she experienced two generalized spasms. Over the next five days, the spasms increased in frequency, severity, and duration, and she also developed dysphagia. Her symptoms stopped worsening after seven days, at which point she began a slow recovery over three weeks. She was still experiencing stiffness at a follow-up clinic three months later.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient was from rural Ethiopia where she performed agricultural work on her smallholding. She had recently flown to Europe to visit family. Key risk factors identified were her agricultural occupation and originating from a country and age group where tetanus vaccination was unlikely.",
  "vitals": "On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were within normal limits. No specific values were recorded.",
  "physical_exam": "Initial clinical examination was unremarkable with no abnormal findings discovered. The principal sign was trismus, or stiffness of the mastication muscles.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The diagnosis was established on purely clinical grounds. An Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) test was considered to rule out giant cell arteritis, but no laboratory results were reported in the case.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The main differential diagnoses considered were early tetanus and giant cell arteritis (GCA). Tetanus was deemed the most likely cause given the patient's significant risk factors, including agricultural work and probable lack of vaccination. GCA was an important consideration for trismus in an older person but was considered less likely.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially treated with metronidazole and tetanus antitoxin on day one. After spasms developed, she was managed in a dark, quiet environment, and treated with diazepam and intrathecal antitoxin. A prophylactic tracheotomy was performed due to the risk of laryngeal spasms. Her symptoms worsened over seven days before stabilizing, and she did not require paralysis or mechanical ventilation. She made a slow recovery over three weeks but still had residual stiffness three months later.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Tetanus. This was determined clinically based on the characteristic presentation of trismus ('stiffness of the mouth') that progressed to generalized spasms and dysphagia. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's epidemiological risk factors, including being an agricultural worker from rural Ethiopia and her likely unvaccinated status. The clinical course of deterioration for several days despite treatment, followed by a plateau and slow recovery, is classic for tetanus.",
  "disease_name_short": "Tetanus"
