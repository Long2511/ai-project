  "patient_information": "A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent who was born in Europe. Due to being born in Europe, she was considered unlikely to have any immunity to malaria.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fever, followed three days later by abnormal behaviour and confusion.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient developed a fever 18 days after returning to Europe from a trip to Nigeria. Three days after the onset of fever, she became very unwell with abnormal behaviour and confusion. At the time of clinical presentation, she was mildly jaundiced and confused.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. As a person of African descent born in Europe, she is part of a group at high risk for imported malaria, often due to not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. The area of travel is known for both malaria and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa).",
  "vitals": "On examination, she had a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was mildly jaundiced and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15. She had no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and her throat and sclerae were not injected. Examination of the chest revealed some fine crepitations at the lung bases.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "A malaria blood film was positive for Plasmodium falciparum with a parasite count of 18%. Blood tests demonstrated acute kidney injury with a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L. During her hospital course, chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS. Initial laboratory testing was delayed due to concern for viral haemorrhagic fever.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis was severe falciparum malaria, the most common cause of fever with jaundice or confusion in a returnee from West Africa. Other causes considered included acute viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, ascending cholangitis, advanced HIV, and Gram-negative sepsis. Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) like Lassa was considered a risk but deemed less likely due to the long incubation period (18+ days) and the absence of injected sclerae or rash.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. Her urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, and she required haemofiltration for deteriorating renal function. Despite a drop in her parasite count to 5%, she lapsed into a deep coma. After the parasites cleared on day 5, her consciousness level improved, but she developed laboured breathing and ARDS, requiring prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is severe falciparum malaria, confirmed by a blood film showing a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18%. The clinical syndrome of fever, confusion (cerebral malaria), jaundice, acute kidney injury, and ARDS following travel to an endemic area is characteristic of severe malaria. Her clinical course and eventual recovery after treatment with intravenous artesunate are consistent with this diagnosis.",
