  "patient_information": "A 24-year-old Malawian businessman recently diagnosed with HIV one week prior to presentation, with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. He has not yet started antiretroviral medication. He has no history of previous tuberculosis. His wife is also HIV-positive.",
  "chief_complaint": "Progressing dark skin spots for one month, new facial swelling, and a three-month history of cough and worsening shortness of breath.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For the past month, the patient noticed dark spots on his arm and leg that were progressing, and he subsequently developed facial swelling. He also reports a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum accompanied by worsening shortness of breath. He denied any constitutional symptoms, including weight loss, fevers, or night sweats.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a businessman from Malawi. His wife is also HIV-positive, and his two young children have not yet been tested. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures are detailed.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, his temperature was 36°C (96.8°F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was comfortable at rest with moderate facial oedema. Examination revealed widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Respiratory assessment showed decreased air entry and dullness at the right lung base. His right leg was swollen from the foot to the knee, with prominent, coalescing dark plaques. The rest of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient was confirmed to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. His hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and MCV was 88.4 fL. Sputum microscopy and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests were negative for tuberculosis. A chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifications with peribronchovascular changes in the lower and mid lung zones, noted as being typical for pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses were Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and pulmonary tuberculosis. The skin and palatal lesions were described as typical for KS, strongly suggesting the diagnosis and raising suspicion for pulmonary involvement. Tuberculosis was considered essential to rule out in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient with a chronic cough, especially as dual pathology with KS is not uncommon.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient's primary concern was shortness of breath. Investigations for tuberculosis were negative. A bronchoscopy was attempted but failed due to technical difficulties. He received a short course of oral antibiotics with no improvement. He was subsequently referred to start antiretroviral medication and palliative chemotherapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Kaposi's sarcoma with extensive cutaneous, palatal, and pulmonary involvement, occurring in the context of advanced, untreated HIV infection (AIDS). The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical findings of widespread purplish plaques, a low CD4 count (134 cells/µL), and chest X-ray findings typical for pulmonary KS. Tuberculosis was actively considered and reasonably excluded based on negative sputum and GeneXpert tests.",
  "disease_name_short": "Kaposi's sarcoma"
