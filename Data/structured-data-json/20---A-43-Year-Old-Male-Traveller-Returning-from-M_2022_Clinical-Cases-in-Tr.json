  "patient_information": "A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.",
  "chief_complaint": "Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation. He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.",
  "vitals": "On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.",
