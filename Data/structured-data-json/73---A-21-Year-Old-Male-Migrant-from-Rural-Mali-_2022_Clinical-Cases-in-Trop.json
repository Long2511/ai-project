  "patient_information": "A 21-year-old male migrant from rural Mali. He comes from a poor family, was initially unable to read or write, and had no other reported comorbidities. He was referred from a haematology department where a work-up for his condition was inconclusive.",
  "chief_complaint": "Referral for splenomegaly and bicytopenia; the patient reports intermittent fever and a feeling of \"heaviness\" on the left side of his abdomen.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reports intermittent fever and abdominal heaviness on the left side for some time, though the exact duration is difficult to specify. He is otherwise clinically well, with no night sweats and a stable weight. An initial work-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at an outside department did not establish a diagnosis.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a migrant from rural Mali who arrived in Germany one year prior to presentation. His journey included crossing Niger, spending several weeks in a detention center in Libya, and traveling through Italy to Germany. His origin in rural Mali constitutes significant exposure to stable malaria transmission.",
  "vitals": "At presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.98°F), blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a pulse of 64 bpm.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared clinically well. The main finding was a massively enlarged spleen palpated 15 cm below the left costal margin. There was no clinical anaemia or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac sounds were clear with no murmurs. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed splenomegaly with a spleen measuring 21.8 cm in longitudinal diameter with a homogenous parenchyma. The liver was normal in size, and flow in the portal and splenic veins was normal. There was no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial labs revealed a mild bicytopenia (WBC 3.3 x10⁹/L, Platelets 124 x10⁹/L). A key finding was a markedly elevated IgM of 8.59 g/L (reference range 0.4-2.3). Inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR were normal. Thick and thin blood films for Plasmodium were negative. However, P. falciparum indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was positive with a titer of 1:256. Further investigation with a PCR for P. falciparum DNA came back positive. Serologies for HIV, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis were all negative, as were blood cultures.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis was hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), supported by massive splenomegaly, very high IgM, positive malaria serology, and origin from an endemic area. Other possibilities were considered and deemed less likely: lymphoma/leukemia (due to normal differential count and LDH), visceral leishmaniasis (patient not severely ill), and schistosomiasis (normal liver on ultrasound).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. His reported episodes of fever subsequently subsided. Malaria PCR was still positive two weeks later but remained negative thereafter. He was monitored for 2.5 years, during which his IgM levels normalized (over 2 years) and his spleen size slowly decreased to 14 cm. The patient remained well and was permitted to stay in Germany after a medical letter was issued regarding the risk of splenic rupture if deported.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS). This was confirmed in a patient from a malaria-endemic area (rural Mali) presenting with massive splenomegaly, bicytopenia, and exceptionally high polyclonal IgM. Although peripheral blood smears were negative, the diagnosis was supported by positive P. falciparum serology (IFAT 1:256) and definitively established by a positive P. falciparum PCR. The diagnosis was further solidified by the excellent clinical response (resolution of fever) and immunological/radiological improvement (slow decrease in IgM and spleen size) following a single course of antimalarial therapy.",
