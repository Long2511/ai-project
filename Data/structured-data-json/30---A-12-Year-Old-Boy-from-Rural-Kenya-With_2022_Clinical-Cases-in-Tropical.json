  "patient_information": "A 12-year-old boy from rural Kenya, described as systemically well with no other reported comorbidities.",
  "chief_complaint": "A two-month history of painful, watery, red eyes with difficulty keeping them open.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reported a 2-month history of painful, watery, red eyes that were worse in the sun, causing him to struggle to keep them open. Six months prior, he was treated for less severe symptoms with tetracycline eye ointment without improvement. Following this, he received treatment from a traditional healer who applied juice extracts from an Aloe vera species plant. After this instillation, he experienced severe eye pain, discharge, and profound redness, after which he could hardly see.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The boy lives with his parents in a pastoralist community in Loima, Turkana County, a hot, dusty, and dry area of Kenya. The family fetches water from a dried riverbed 6 kilometers from their home. They keep herds of cows and sheep, and the boy assists with herding and watering, consistent with environmental risk factors for trachoma.",
  "vitals": "The patient appeared systemically well; specific vital signs were not reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Vision was severely impaired: perception of hand movements only in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. The right eye showed fibrotic lids, loss of lid architecture, and trichiasis of the upper lid. The conjunctiva was severely inflamed with follicles and scarring. The cornea had diffuse opacification with central thinning and a fibrovascular pannus. The left eye had swollen lids, misdirected eyelashes, an everted lower lid margin, focal corneal scars (one with an adherent iris indicating a previous perforation), a shallow anterior chamber, and a distorted pupil.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "No laboratory investigations were reported. The diagnosis was made based on clinical examination findings. While Vitamin A deficiency was considered in the differential, blood retinol levels were not measured.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses considered were: 1) Corneal and conjunctival damage resulting from the use of traditional eye medicine, 2) Trachomatous trichiasis, and 3) Vitamin A deficiency. The history supported chemical injury from traditional medicine, but the chronic scarring and specific inflammatory signs were highly characteristic of advanced trachoma.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was diagnosed with bilateral trachomatous trichiasis (TT), corneal opacity (CO), and a left perforating corneal ulcer, likely exacerbated by traditional medicine. He was admitted and treated with oral azithromycin and oral vitamin A supplements. A referral was made to an ophthalmologist for surgical management, including lid surgery to correct the trichiasis and a conjunctival flap to seal the corneal defect.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Bilateral trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity (CO) secondary to chronic infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The diagnosis was established clinically based on the presence of all five characteristic signs of trachoma: tarsal follicles, conjunctival scarring, Herbert's pits, fibrovascular pannus, and trichiasis. The severity, including a perforated corneal ulcer in the left eye, was likely compounded by the application of traditional medicine. This constellation of findings is classic for advanced trachoma and less consistent with other differentials in isolation.",
