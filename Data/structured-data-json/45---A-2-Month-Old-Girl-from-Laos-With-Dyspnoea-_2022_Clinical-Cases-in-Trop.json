  "patient_information": "A 2-month-old baby girl from Laos, born at term and previously well. Her mother is a 24-year-old rice farmer. The infant was exclusively breastfed.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 3-day history of irritability, dyspnoea, and grunting.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The infant suddenly became unwell three days prior to presentation. She developed irritability, dyspnoea, grunting, and was breastfeeding poorly. The mother reported the baby was neither feverish nor coughing, and had been perfectly well since birth.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The infant resides in Laos and is exclusively breastfed. Her mother, a rice farmer, practiced prolonged postpartum food avoidance, a common cultural practice involving a diet of mainly milled glutinous rice while avoiding beef, pork, vegetables, and fruits. The mother herself had symptoms of anorexia, weakness, a husky voice, and paresthesias, suggestive of her own thiamine deficiency.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, the temperature was 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse was 140 bpm, and respiratory rate was 40 breaths per minute. The blood pressure was not taken. The child was dyspnoeic and had central cyanosis.",
  "physical_exam": "The infant was irritable, crying, and grunting. Examination revealed signs of heart failure, including central cyanosis, hepatomegaly, and oedematous extremities. Her chest was clear on auscultation, and no heart murmurs were heard.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood samples were taken from both the child and the mother. Laboratory analysis confirmed that both were thiamine-deficient. No other specific lab results were reported in the case.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included congenital heart disease, respiratory diseases (e.g., bronchopneumonia), meningitis, and infantile beriberi. Respiratory disease was deemed unlikely due to the absence of cough, wheeze, fever, and a normal chest exam. Congenital heart disease was less likely given the sudden onset of symptoms well after birth and the absence of a heart murmur. Meningitis was considered improbable without fever or bulging fontanels. The combination of dyspnoea, poor feeding, abnormal cry, and signs of heart failure in an infant from an endemic area strongly suggested infantile beriberi.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The child was immediately given intravenous thiamine (50 mg). She showed a quick and dramatic response to the treatment. Six hours after administration, she was able to breastfeed normally and was subsequently discharged the following day. The mother was prescribed oral thiamine supplementation and received counseling to consume a well-balanced, thiamine-rich diet.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is infantile beriberi, which is a clinical thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of acute heart failure in an exclusively breastfed infant from an endemic region, and it was confirmed by the rapid and dramatic response to intravenous thiamine. Subsequent biochemical analysis verified that both the mother and child were thiamine-deficient, a result of the mother's restricted postpartum diet.",
