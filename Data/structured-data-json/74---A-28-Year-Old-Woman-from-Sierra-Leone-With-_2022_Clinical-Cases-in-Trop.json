  "patient_information": "A 28-year-old woman from eastern Sierra Leone with no prior medical history reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain, along with loose stools for the past 2 days. She was seen at a local health post the day prior and received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin but continued to worsen. On arrival at the hospital, her exam was notable only for mild pharyngitis. Despite treatment with IV ceftriaxone and completing the antimalarial course, her condition deteriorated. Two days after admission, she developed conjunctivitis, cough, and breathlessness, becoming very unwell and unable to walk unaided.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient presented to a small rural hospital in eastern Sierra Leone. This region is noted to have a high incidence of Lassa fever, which accounts for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some local studies. Lassa fever is a zoonosis transmitted through contact with infected rat urine.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her axillary temperature was 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 80/55 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 100 bpm.",
  "physical_exam": "Initial examination was unremarkable except for mild pharyngitis. As her illness progressed, she developed conjunctivitis and bilateral fine crepitations on chest auscultation.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Her initial malaria slide was negative. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood chemistry showed mild renal impairment and raised transaminases, with an aspartate transaminase (AST/GOT) of 514 U/L (normal <50 U/L). The diagnosis of Lassa fever was later confirmed with antigen testing.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis included several possibilities. Adenovirus and measles can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, but adenovirus is typically mild and a rash would be expected with measles. Mycoplasma and other pneumonias do not typically cause conjunctivitis. Leptospirosis can present with non-specific fever and pulmonary involvement but usually causes conjunctival suffusion rather than conjunctivitis. Typhoid was considered, but improvement would be expected on ceftriaxone, and pharyngitis/conjunctivitis are not typical features. Lassa fever was considered highly likely given the patient's signs, symptoms, and location in an endemic area.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient initially received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin without improvement. At the hospital, she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and completed her antimalarial course, but continued to deteriorate. After Lassa fever was confirmed by antigen testing, she was moved to a specialist isolation unit and received IV ribavirin. Strict infection control measures were implemented. Unfortunately, she was already very unwell and died 2 days later. Public health follow-up was initiated for all family, friends, and medical staff contacts.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was Lassa fever, a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by an arenavirus. This was confirmed by a positive antigen test. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of a severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, renal impairment, and elevated liver transaminases, which was refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials. The patient's presence in eastern Sierra Leone, a highly endemic area, provided strong epidemiological evidence. The patient succumbed to the illness despite late initiation of IV ribavirin.",
