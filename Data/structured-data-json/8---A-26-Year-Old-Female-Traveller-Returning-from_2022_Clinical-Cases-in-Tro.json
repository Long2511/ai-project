  "patient_information": "A 26-year-old German student, described as otherwise fine, with no reported history of significant medical conditions.",
  "chief_complaint": "A localized, itchy swelling on the left leg that has been slowly developing over three weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 26-year-old female presents with a localized swelling on her left leg that developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. The lesion is reported to be itchy but not painful. She has no history of fever or recalled arthropod bites and feels well systemically.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient had just returned from a 6-week backpacking trip to Ghana. In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is often caused by the Tumbu fly, which lays eggs on damp laundry or sandy ground. Humans can become hosts by wearing contaminated clothing that has not been hot-ironed or by lying on contaminated ground.",
  "vitals": "The patient was afebrile at the time of examination. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "On the left leg, there was a localized swelling approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, covered by a blackish scab. The surrounding skin was slightly hyperaemic. There was no associated lymphadenopathy, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "No laboratory or imaging studies were performed. Diagnosis was made clinically after the scab was removed, revealing a whitish, pulsating matter underneath that was oozing transparent fluid. Under a magnifying glass, this was identified as the pulsating end of a larva, containing respiratory spiracles, which is typical for myiasis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included rickettsial disease and cutaneous anthrax, which were deemed unlikely due to the absence of systemic symptoms. A spider bite was also considered but made less probable by the slow growth over weeks. Localized bacterial infections like furuncles were a possibility given the travel history, but the most likely diagnosis was myiasis (infestation with fly maggots) based on the slow growth, lack of systemic signs, and localized itch.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The lesion was managed by occluding the larva's respiratory spiracles to deprive it of oxygen. The area was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned two days later, at which point the maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with forceps. The remaining lesion appeared clean, and no further treatment was necessary. The condition is noted to be self-limiting as the mature larva eventually leaves the host.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga. The diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical presentation of a slowly growing, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and definitively established by the direct visualization of the pulsating larva with its respiratory spiracles after removal of the scab, followed by its successful extraction. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial infection or spider bite were excluded based on the lesion's slow, non-painful evolution and the absence of systemic symptoms.",
