  "patient_information": "A 34-year-old Malawian woman diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV 5 months prior to presentation. At that time, her baseline CD4 count was 54/µL. She is currently taking antituberculous therapy, vitamin B6, antiretroviral therapy, and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.",
  "chief_complaint": "Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a 3-month period.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's problems began approximately 3 months earlier with a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed insidiously, and over the following weeks, her left arm also became affected. She is noted to be a poor historian. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment, or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in an urban high-density area in Malawi and works as a street vendor. She is divorced and has no children. No specific exposures to animals, water, or sick contacts are mentioned.",
  "vitals": "The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "General examination is normal except for slightly pale conjunctivae. Fundoscopy is normal with no signs of papilloedema or retinitis. Neurological examination reveals a spastic hemiparesis on the left with hyperreflexia. Power is 2/5 in the left leg and 3/5 in the left arm, with a pronator drift on the left. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "A full blood count showed a WBC of 3.8 x 10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelets of 140 x 10⁹/L. Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for focal brain lesions in this HIV-positive patient included cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CNS tuberculosis. The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient's existing antiretroviral, antituberculous, and co-trimoxazole therapies were continued. She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.",
  "final_diagnosis": "A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.",
