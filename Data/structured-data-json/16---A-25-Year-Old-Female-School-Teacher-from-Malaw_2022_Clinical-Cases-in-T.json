  "patient_information": "A 25-year-old Malawian primary school teacher who is HIV-positive and on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz for 6 months with good adherence. Her CD4 count upon starting ART was 320 cells/µL. She had completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 months prior.",
  "chief_complaint": "Abrupt onset of high fever, confusion, and convulsions.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was reported to be well at 8 a.m., but became confused by 10 a.m. and was then drowsy with a high fever and convulsions upon admission to a central hospital at 11 a.m., indicating a very rapid clinical deterioration over just a few hours.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a primary school teacher residing in Malawi. The text notes that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in adults in Africa. There is no mention of specific travel, animal, or other environmental exposures.",
  "vitals": "On admission, her temperature was 40°C (104°F), pulse was 125 bpm, blood pressure was 125/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was restless and agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10/15. Physical examination revealed a stiff neck, a positive Kernig's sign, photophobia with equal and reactive pupils, and down-going plantar responses. No rash was present. Chest and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. During the physical examination, she suffered a renewed seizure.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 10.5 x10^9/L (neutrophils 8.9 x10^9/L), haemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and normal platelets. A rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum was negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared hazy. CSF analysis showed 35 leukocytes/µL (60% neutrophils), a high protein of 2.6 g/L, and a low glucose of 1.2 mmol/L. The CSF culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The main differential diagnoses considered were acute bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and cryptococcal meningitis (CCM). Acute bacterial meningitis was deemed most likely due to the hyperacute presentation. TBM was considered less likely due to the patient's recent completion of TB therapy and the rapid onset, while CCM was less likely because her CD4 count was too high and it typically presents more sub-acutely.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "In the emergency department, the patient received ceftriaxone 2g IV for the suspected meningitis, along with 10mg of diazepam IV and 600mg of phenobarbitone IV for seizure control. She completed a 10-day course of IV ceftriaxone. The patient recovered consciousness by day 3, and anticonvulsants were weaned. She developed a minor hearing loss in her right ear but had no other neurological impairment or seizures upon recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was definitively confirmed by a positive CSF culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, altered consciousness, and signs of meningeal irritation (stiff neck, Kernig's sign), combined with classic CSF findings of a neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose. Other causes like tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis were clinically less likely.",
  "disease_name_short": "Acute Bacterial Meningitis"
