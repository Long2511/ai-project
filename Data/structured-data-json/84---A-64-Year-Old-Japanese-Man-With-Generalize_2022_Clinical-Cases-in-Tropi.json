  "patient_information": "A 64-year-old Japanese man with a medical history of hypertension and a right cerebellar infarction. He also had a history of simple partial seizures that were well controlled by the administration of an antiepileptic agent.",
  "chief_complaint": "Generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by weakness of the right lower extremity.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was admitted to a local hospital in Japan due to the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which were followed by weakness in his right lower extremity. This presentation was distinct from his prior history of simple partial seizures, which had been well-controlled on medication.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resided in Japan. The suspected route of infection was the consumption of raw chicken meat, which he reported eating approximately once a month prior to the onset of the generalized seizure.",
  "vitals": "On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The neurological examination performed on admission did not reveal any abnormality.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed no abnormalities, specifically noting no eosinophilia or leukocytosis. A head CT revealed a small high-density nodule with an enhanced perifocal low-density area in the left occipital lobe. Subsequent MRI showed a ring-enhancing, tunnel-shaped lesion in the same location, described as the 'tunnel sign'. After surgery, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on serum and cerebrospinal fluid revealed strong positivity for Spirometra mansoni.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnoses considered for a space-occupying central nervous system lesion include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Cerebral sparganosis was suspected based on the combination of clinical presentation and characteristic imaging findings.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient underwent an open surgery with craniotomy targeting the brain lesion. During the procedure, a live, white, tape-like, worm-like structure was exposed and completely removed. A presumed diagnosis of sparganosis was made intraoperatively. Following the surgical removal of the worm, the patient remained well and was without seizures at his most recent examination.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is cerebral sparganosis, an infection of the brain with a larval cestode of the genus Spirometra. This was confirmed by the surgical removal of a live, worm-like structure from a lesion in the left occipital lobe, which was identified as a sparganum. The diagnosis was further supported by characteristic 'tunnel sign' enhancement on MRI and strongly positive ELISA results for Spirometra mansoni in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid.",
