  "patient_information": "A 16-year-old Sri Lankan boy who was attending school until the onset of his illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches for 2 days, with anuria for the preceding 12 hours.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented to a local hospital with a 2-day history of fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches. During this illness, he had vomited two to three times and had not passed any urine for the 12 hours prior to presentation. He reported no cough, coryza, or shortness of breath.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in Sri Lanka. Five days before falling ill, he had been fishing in an urban water stream.",
  "vitals": "On clinical examination, his temperature was 38.3°C (100.9°F), the pulse rate was 100 bpm (low in volume), and his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "The boy appeared ill, drowsy, jaundiced, and had subconjunctival haemorrhages. There was severe muscle tenderness, mainly involving the abdominal wall and calves, making it difficult for him to walk. The liver was palpable 4cm below the right costal margin and was tender. Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness was present. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Examination of the heart and lungs was normal, and the neurological examination was also normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia (platelets 96 ×10⁹/L) and acute renal failure (blood urea nitrogen 20.7 µmol/L, serum creatinine 212.2 µmol/L). Liver function tests showed cholestatic jaundice with a total bilirubin of 77 µmol/L and direct bilirubin of 54.7 µmol/L, along with mildly elevated AST (64 IU/L) and ALT (58 IU/L). C-reactive protein was elevated at 48 mg/L. The white blood cell count was normal at 5.7 ×10⁹/L. Urine microscopy showed 20 red blood cells per high-power field, protein '+', and granular casts '+'. A chest radiograph was normal and an ECG showed sinus tachycardia.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was leptospirosis, given the presentation of acute febrile illness with jaundice, renal failure, and a history of exposure to potentially contaminated water. Other diagnoses considered included scrub typhus, which can present similarly but often involves an eschar and lymphadenopathy; hantavirus infection, due to its similar epidemiology; and dengue haemorrhagic fever, in which acute kidney injury and jaundice are uncommon.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Severe leptospirosis was suspected, and the patient was started on empirical benzylpenicillin. Despite rehydration, he developed acute renal failure requiring haemodialysis (HD). His hospital course was complicated by myocarditis and atrial fibrillation, but he tolerated further HD sessions. The patient gradually recovered over 10 days with intensive care management.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is severe leptospirosis, presenting as Weil's syndrome. This is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, cholestatic jaundice, and acute renal failure, along with findings of subconjunctival haemorrhage, severe myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is further corroborated by the clear epidemiological link of fishing in an urban stream five days prior to symptom onset. Although specific diagnostic tests were not detailed, the clinical suspicion was high, and the patient's recovery following empirical antibiotic therapy and intensive supportive care, including dialysis, aligns with this diagnosis.",
