  "patient_information": "A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously, and a recent HIV ELISA test was negative. The patient denies recent travels.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, and significant weight loss.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized for similar complaints, at which time three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical and radiographic findings, and he was started on first-line TB therapy. Despite adherence, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistent cough that developed streaking of blood, leading to a referral for suspected multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB).",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a farmer from a rural area in the Peruvian Amazon. His occupation and geographic origin are relevant for endemic fungal infections. He denies recent travels.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, his temperature was 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg, pulse was 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared fatigued and cachectic. Examination revealed a few small, mobile, soft, non-tender cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes. Auscultation of the lungs found bilateral crackles and rhonchi. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed significant thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 1093 × 10^9/L; the rest of the full blood count was normal. Two repeated AFB smears and a tuberculin skin test were negative. A chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates, predominantly in the central and upper zones, with multiple cavities in the right lung and no hilar lymphadenopathy. Examination of a sputum potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed the characteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and the organism was subsequently grown in culture.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses considered were MDR TB, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. TB is highly endemic in Peru, making it a necessary consideration. Histoplasmosis can mimic TB symptoms. However, paracoccidioidomycosis was deemed most likely given the patient's age, gender, occupation (farmer), geographic origin (Peruvian Amazon), and clinical presentation, which are all typical for the chronic form of this mycosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initial treatment with first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was ineffective. After the definitive diagnosis was made, TB treatment was discontinued. Due to the extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole. The thrombocytosis was considered a reactive process to the chronic infection.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. It was confirmed by the visualization of characteristic yeast forms on a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, with subsequent isolation in fungal culture. The clinical picture, including the failure to respond to empiric TB therapy and the patient's specific demographic and exposure profile as a farmer from the Peruvian Amazon, strongly supported this diagnosis over tuberculosis.",
