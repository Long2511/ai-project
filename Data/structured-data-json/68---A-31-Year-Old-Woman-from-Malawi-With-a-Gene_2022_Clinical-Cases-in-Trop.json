  "patient_information": "A 31-year-old woman from Malawi with no known allergies. She was diagnosed as HIV positive two months prior when she was hospitalized for cryptococcal meningitis and treated with high-dose oral fluconazole. One month before presentation, she was started on antiretroviral therapy (stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP)) along with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.",
  "chief_complaint": "A generalized skin rash for three days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient developed a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk three days ago and subsequently spread to her extremities and mucosal membranes, including the lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa. One day before the rash appeared, she developed a productive cough with whitish sputum. For the past two days, she has also experienced a sore throat and dysuria. The rash is associated with painful difficulty in opening her mouth, talking, and eating.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in Malawi and her main exposure is pharmacological. She was initiated on nevirapine and co-trimoxazole one month prior to the onset of her symptoms. The case notes that the incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is much higher in HIV-positive individuals, a relevant epidemiological factor in sub-Saharan Africa.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her temperature was 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure was 120/68 mmHg, pulse was 90 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "There is a generalized, non-itchy maculopapular rash involving the skin and mucous membranes, which spares the palms and soles. Bilateral conjunctivitis is present, and the eyelids and lips are swollen and covered with haemorrhagic crusts. The lips are so swollen she can hardly open her mouth. The chest is clear on auscultation.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "A rapid malaria test and blood cultures were performed due to fever, and both were negative. No other specific laboratory results are provided. The diagnosis was made clinically.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary diagnosis considered was Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to a drug reaction. The prodromal symptoms of cough and sore throat could be mistaken for a bacterial or viral infection, or for malaria in a tropical setting. However, malaria was ruled out by a negative rapid test. The clinical picture with severe mucocutaneous involvement following initiation of nevirapine and co-trimoxazole is highly characteristic of SJS/TEN.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "On admission, all potentially causative drugs, including the antiretroviral therapy and co-trimoxazole, were stopped. She received IV fluids and a urinary catheter was inserted. For local care, she was given 0.9% normal saline as a mouthwash and dexamethasone eye ointment. Her fever and cough resolved spontaneously, and she was discharged after 10 days. After her lesions completely healed, she was restarted on a new antiretroviral combination where nevirapine was replaced by efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole was not replaced as no alternative was available. The new drug regimen was well tolerated without recurrence of the rash.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. This was most likely caused by her recently initiated medications, nevirapine and/or co-trimoxazole, both of which are strongly associated with SJS. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic generalized maculopapular rash with severe involvement of multiple mucosal surfaces (oral, conjunctival, genital), haemorrhagic crusting of the lips, and the temporal association with drug initiation one month prior. The patient's HIV-positive status is a major risk factor. Infectious etiologies like malaria were ruled out.",
