  "patient_information": "A 55-year-old woman of Turkish provenance with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood, leading to mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacements at ages 37 and 53, respectively.",
  "chief_complaint": "Intermittent fever up to 39.5°C, night sweats, chest pain, and fatigue.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with intermittent fever, night sweats, chest pain, and fatigue. She was initially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with co-trimoxazole, which led to the fever settling and some improvement. However, she subsequently developed increasing dyspnoea and progressed into congestive heart failure.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient had visited relatives in Turkey several weeks prior to her hospital presentation in Germany.",
  "vitals": "The patient experienced intermittent fever up to 39.5°C (103.1°F). Her blood pressure and heart rate were reported to be within normal limits.",
  "physical_exam": "Clinical findings included unremarkable prosthetic heart sounds and a systolic grade 1 murmur over the aortic area without radiation. The liver and spleen were not enlarged. No lymph nodes were palpable, and no haemorrhages or petechiae were detected.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial labs showed slight anaemia (Hb 11.5g/dL) and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein at 15 mg/dL. White blood cell count and platelets were normal. Initial blood cultures were negative, while a urinary culture grew Enterobacteriaceae. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed competent prosthetic valves. After 4 weeks, the initial blood cultures grew Brucella melitensis biovar 2. A follow-up transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation attached to the prosthetic mitral valve and later, an annular abscess around the aortic prosthesis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "After the patient deteriorated despite initial treatment, the differential diagnosis included urosepsis. Due to the patient's travel history to Turkey, other infections such as brucellosis, tuberculosis, or Q-fever were considered. Given her two prosthetic heart valves, infective endocarditis was a primary concern.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was first treated with co-trimoxazole for a presumed UTI. After the diagnosis of Brucella endocarditis, treatment was initiated with rifampicin, doxycycline, and gentamicin, leading to rapid improvement. C-reactive protein normalized after 6 weeks of triple therapy. Two months later, however, an annular abscess was found, requiring a third thoracotomy for prosthesis exchange. After surgery, the patient made a complete and sustained recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was active Brucella endocarditis caused by Brucella melitensis biovar 2. This was confirmed by the eventual growth of the organism from blood cultures after 4 weeks of incubation, combined with transoesophageal echocardiography findings of a large vegetation on the prosthetic mitral valve. The diagnosis explains the initial presentation of fever of unknown origin in a patient with prosthetic heart valves and a relevant travel history to an endemic region.",
