  "patient_information": "A 34-year-old man, originally from northern Peru, who has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He has a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively. His Peruvian wife and children are reported as healthy at presentation.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea with colicky abdominal pain and a weight loss of approximately 20 kg.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. For over 12 years, he has suffered from recurrent, less severe episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but the frequency of these episodes has increased over the past 2 years.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is an immigrant from northern Peru, a tropical region described as highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. He has resided in Chile for the last 9 years. His family history is notable for two close relatives (mother and brother) dying from wasting syndromes of unknown origin. Later investigation revealed his wife had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and was also HTLV-1 positive; one of his two children also had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection but was HTLV-1 negative.",
  "vitals": "The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient is cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass, a body weight of 44 kg, and a BMI of 17. Abdominal examination revealed slight pain on palpation. Otherwise, the physical examination was normal, with no fever, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable lymphadenopathy, and no peripheral oedema.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis (WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L), thrombocytosis (platelets 644 x 10^9/L), mild anemia (haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (protein 4.9 g/dL), and an elevated ESR (26 mm/h). An HIV test was negative. Abdominal CT and MRI scans were without pathological findings, and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was macroscopically normal. However, histology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Subsequent Baermann testing of a fresh stool sample demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis, and larvae were also found in respiratory secretions. Serology confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea and wasting in this patient centered on helminth infections. The two main considerations were Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium or Cystoisospora belli were also a possibility, though less likely in an HIV-negative patient. Given the patient's origin from a region highly endemic for S. stercoralis, this was considered the most probable cause.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. Following the diagnosis, he was treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day for 7 days), which was repeated after a 2-week interval. He recovered from his diarrhea and abdominal symptoms within weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, he had gained 13 kg, was free of postprandial cramps for the first time in over 10 years, and parasitological examination was negative. His wife and one child were also found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and were presumably treated.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann technique) and respiratory secretions. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a known risk factor, HTLV-1 co-infection (confirmed by serology), and the patient's geographic origin from an endemic area. The clinical picture of severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, along with the dramatic response to ivermectin, solidified the diagnosis.",
