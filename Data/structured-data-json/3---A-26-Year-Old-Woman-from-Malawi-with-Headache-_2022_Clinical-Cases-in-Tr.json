  "patient_information": "A 26-year-old Malawian woman with an unremarkable past medical history. She is a businesswoman who lives in an urban high-density area. Four of her children died as toddlers, and her husband died a year prior of 'high fever'. She was subsequently found to be HIV-reactive.",
  "chief_complaint": "Insidious onset headache, confusion, and unilateral ptosis developing over the course of one week.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient had been unwell for at least one week with a headache of insidious onset. This was followed by confusion for the two days prior to presentation. One day before she was brought to the hospital, her relatives noticed a drooping of her left eyelid.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in an urban, high-density area in Malawi. Her husband's death from 'high fever' a year ago and her eventual HIV-positive status are significant risk factors for opportunistic infections. Thick films for malaria and trypanosomes were negative.",
  "vitals": "On examination, her temperature was 38.4°C (101.1°F), blood pressure was 115/75 mmHg, heart rate was 86 bpm, and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 14/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared seriously unwell. The neurological examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15 and a left-sided third nerve palsy, with complete ptosis and the eye in a 'down and out' position on primary gaze. There was no neck stiffness. Her chest was clear, and the remainder of her neurological examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood tests showed a WBC of 3.2 ×10⁹/L and hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL. A lumbar puncture revealed a markedly raised opening pressure of 32 cmH₂O. The CSF was inflammatory, with a white cell count of 54/μL, a very high protein of 3.0 g/L, and a low glucose of 1.3 mmol/L (paired with a serum glucose of 4.0 mmol/L). An HIV test was reactive. CSF microscopy revealed acid-fast bacilli, while India Ink stain, cryptococcal antigen, and bacterial cultures were negative. An MRI of the brain later showed bilateral basal ganglia infarctions.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis included bacterial, tuberculous, and cryptococcal meningitis. The clinical and initial CSF findings were not specific enough to reliably distinguish between these possibilities. Cerebral malaria was considered but deemed less likely in a semi-immune adult, especially with a cranial nerve palsy. Viral or protozoan encephalitis was also considered less likely given the CSF profile of very high protein and low glucose.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was started on empiric treatment covering the main differentials, including ceftriaxone 2g bid, fluconazole 1200 mg daily, and presumptive treatment for TB-meningitis. Despite this, her condition deteriorated, and she slipped into a coma a few days into treatment. She ultimately died in the hospital.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was established by the detection of acid-fast bacilli in the cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis was supported by the patient's HIV-positive status, a subacute clinical course of headache and cranial nerve palsy, and typical CSF findings of high opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, markedly elevated protein, and low glucose. The cause of death was related to severe complications of the disease, specifically bilateral basal ganglia infarctions secondary to vasculitis, as seen on MRI.",
  "disease_name_short": "Tuberculous meningitis"
