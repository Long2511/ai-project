  "patient_information": "A 24-year-old woman from the highlands of Peru who was previously healthy. She is single and has no children.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 2-month history of upper abdominal pain and weight loss, with a 2-week history of intermittent fevers.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain, a 5 kg weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, complicated by intermittent fevers for the past 2 weeks. Analgesics did not control her pain. Three days prior, she was evaluated in an emergency room where an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic liver lesions. She was treated empirically for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses with ceftriaxone and metronidazole but showed no clinical improvement.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in the highlands of Peru. Approximately 2 to 3 months before her illness, she changed to a vegetarian diet and began consuming energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. She also started taking over-the-counter medicines for weight loss.",
  "vitals": "On admission, her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg, pulse was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared ill and had pale mucous membranes but no jaundice. Palpation of the abdomen revealed right upper quadrant tenderness. The liver was slightly enlarged with a span of 15 cm. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results on admission were notable for a WBC count of 13.94 x 10^9/L with pronounced eosinophilia at 43% (total eosinophil count 5.97). Hemoglobin was 12.3 g/dL. Liver function tests showed a mildly elevated ALT at 55 U/L and an elevated alkaline phosphatase at 170 U/L. An abdominal ultrasound and a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen both demonstrated multiple liver lesions, described as hypoechoic and hypodense, non-enhancing, respectively. A subsequent Fas2 ELISA test was positive with a titre of 0.56 (normal <0.2).",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The initial working diagnosis was pyogenic liver abscess, but this was considered less likely after the patient failed to improve with 3 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Fascioliasis became the primary consideration due to the patient's origin from the Andes, high eosinophilia, and history of consuming alfalfa and watercress. Amoebic liver abscess was also considered, but the presence of multiple lesions and significant eosinophilia made it less typical. Other endemic infections such as brucellosis and visceral toxocariasis were also on the differential.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "After failing to respond to an initial course of ceftriaxone and metronidazole, the patient received a single 10 mg/kg dose of triclabendazole upon suspicion of fascioliasis. Following this treatment, her clinical symptoms rapidly improved, her laboratory parameters normalized, and follow-up imaging showed that her liver lesions were disappearing.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is acute fascioliasis, caused by the liver fluke *Fasciola hepatica*. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical presentation of fever and abdominal pain, pronounced eosinophilia, and a classic epidemiological link of consuming watercress in an endemic area (Peruvian Andes). The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive Fas2 ELISA serology test, and further substantiated by the rapid clinical and radiological resolution of symptoms and liver lesions after treatment with triclabendazole.",
