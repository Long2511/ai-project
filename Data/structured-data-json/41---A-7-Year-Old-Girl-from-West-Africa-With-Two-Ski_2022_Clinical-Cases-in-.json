  "patient_information": "A 7-year-old girl from a tropical region of a West African country, described as being in good general condition with no history of relevant trauma or systemic symptoms reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "Two progressive skin ulcers on the right hand and wrist with a resulting contracture, developing over a three-month period.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The condition began with an itchy papule on the back of the right hand after a reported insect bite, which enlarged over three months. The lesion ulcerated a few weeks later. She was treated with herbal remedies, then diclofenac, dexamethasone, and later oxacillin without effect. A second lesion appeared, and she developed a progressive inability to use her right hand.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from a tropical region of a West African country, an area where Buruli ulcer is endemic, particularly among children in rural communities. The mode of transmission is noted to be unknown, though endemic areas are often associated with water bodies. The initial insect bite is considered an incidental finding.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her pulse was 108 bpm, blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, and temperature was 37.9°C (100.2°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient held her right wrist in a 45° flexion and 20° abduction contracture. There were two skin ulcers on her right hand: a 3x3 cm ulcer on the back of the hand with necrotic tissue, and a 0.5x1 cm ulcer on the medial wrist. An ill-defined 12x8 cm induration with surrounding hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and desquamation was present, with edema extending to the fingers. A 0.5x0.5 cm nodule was also noted above the medial right elbow.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "PCR performed on a wound swab confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans. No other laboratory or imaging results were reported.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary suspected diagnosis was Buruli ulcer, based on the patient's age, geographic location, and clinical presentation. Other considerations included various infectious causes (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) and non-infectious conditions (trauma, envenoming, autoimmune, haematological, neoplastic). Bacterial superinfection was also considered as a cause for the low-grade fever.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "After initial ineffective treatments, the patient received 8 weeks of specific antimycobacterial therapy and wound care. During this time, the larger ulcer healed almost completely, but the smaller ulcer enlarged to 8x10 cm, consistent with a paradoxical reaction. She subsequently underwent surgical debridement and skin grafting. Physiotherapy was used to correct the wrist contracture, and the patient made an uneventful recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is Buruli ulcer, a necrotizing skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. This was confirmed by a positive PCR test from a wound swab. The clinical presentation of progressive ulcerative lesions with surrounding edema and a joint contracture in a child from an endemic region of West Africa is highly characteristic of the disease. A paradoxical reaction during treatment, where one lesion worsened, further supported the diagnosis.",
