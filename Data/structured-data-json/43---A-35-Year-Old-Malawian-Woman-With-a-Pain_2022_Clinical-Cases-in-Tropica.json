  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old woman from Malawi who is known to be HIV-positive and has been on antiretroviral treatment for the past 3 years. Her CD4 count is unknown.",
  "chief_complaint": "Referral for exenteration of the left eye due to a painful ocular tumour present for eight months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Symptoms started 8 months prior with a whitish lesion on the conjunctiva of her left eye. Initial treatment with non-specified eye drops from a health centre and later herbal eye drops from a traditional healer were ineffective. Over the subsequent months, the lesion grew larger, turned reddish, and she eventually lost her eyesight in that eye. The pain also increased, which prompted her to present to her local district hospital, leading to the referral.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Malawi, a country in sub-Saharan Africa where ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) is commonly seen in HIV-positive individuals. Risk factors for OSSN include HIV infection, ultraviolet radiation, and human papilloma virus (HPV). No other specific exposures were mentioned.",
  "vitals": "The patient was afebrile. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable, and no other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Clinical findings included localized swelling of the left eyeball and orbit with incomplete lid closure and marked axial proptosis. Visual acuity on the right side was 6/6, while the left eye had no light perception. Her left preauricular lymph nodes were swollen. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The patient is known to be HIV-positive, but her CD4 count is unknown. The diagnosis was based on clinical impression, as no histopathological examination or other laboratory results were reported in the case.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The most likely diagnosis was advanced ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Malignant lesions such as amelanotic melanomas, lymphomas, or adenocarcinomas were considered as differential diagnoses. In its early stages, the lesion could have been confused with a pterygium, an amelanotic naevus, or a lipoma.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted to the hospital and counselled for surgery, which she refused, opting for conservative treatment. Her left orbit was covered with antibiotics and a bandage. After her pain was sufficiently controlled, she was discharged with the offer to return for surgery at any time. She was asked to report to her antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic for viral load control and a possible switch of her antiretroviral therapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was advanced Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN), based on a strong clinical impression. This conclusion was reached based on the patient's history as an HIV-positive individual from an endemic region, presenting with a classic, progressively growing conjunctival tumor over 8 months that led to vision loss, pain, and swollen preauricular lymph nodes. Although not confirmed by biopsy, the presentation is highly characteristic of OSSN.",
