  "patient_information": "A 32-year-old Malawian man with a known history of HIV, who was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis two months prior to presentation. His recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL. His past medical history is significant for treatment for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and a painfully swollen neck.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a six-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, accompanied by a painful neck swelling. Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Malawi and had not left the country. Multi-drug resistance for TB is noted to be uncommon in this region. No other specific occupational or environmental exposures are detailed.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, he was moderately ill, pale, and sweating with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), a pulse of 112 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing man with large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. Over the course of his hospital stay, these glands became more swollen and clearly fluctuant. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.",
