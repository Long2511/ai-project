  "patient_information": "A 25-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman, diagnosed with HIV one month prior to presentation. She was not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART) but had been taking co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for 7 days. Her CD4 count on admission was 153 cells/μL. She has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated 4 years ago. The patient is unmarried with three children and denies alcohol or recreational drug use.",
  "chief_complaint": "A new-onset seizure.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was referred from a health centre after suffering her first-ever seizure, which occurred out of sleep. Her son found her on the floor, unresponsive and shaking all four limbs, for a duration of 5 to 10 minutes.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Zambia and works in a hospital cafeteria in Lusaka. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures are detailed.",
  "vitals": "On examination, the patient's vital signs were normal and she was afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared well on examination. There was no meningism, the chest was clear, and the neurological examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "A malaria rapid diagnostic test was negative. Blood results showed a haemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, a CD4 count of 153 cells/μL, and otherwise normal WBC, platelets, sodium, and glucose. A lumbar puncture showed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure, 5 leukocytes/μL, and an elevated protein of 0.78 g/L. CSF was negative for Cryptococcal antigen (CrAG), India Ink, Gram stain, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain. An electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated focal slowing in the right hemisphere. A CT scan of the brain revealed frontal and parietal hypodense lesions in the white matter of the right hemisphere without contrast enhancement.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for a focal brain lesion in an HIV patient with a new-onset seizure included tuberculoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess, primary CNS lymphoma, and neurocysticercosis. The imaging findings of lesions selectively affecting the white matter without contrast enhancement or perifocal oedema were considered strongly suggestive of PML.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was started on carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily for seizure prevention and was commenced on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Subsequently, JC-virus DNA was detected in the CSF, confirming the diagnosis. After 6 months, she was seizure-free and carbamazepine was stopped. One year after starting ART, her CD4 count had recovered to 535 cells/μL and she had returned to work.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus. The diagnosis was made in the context of a new-onset seizure in a patient with advanced HIV and immunosuppression (CD4 count 153). Brain CT findings of non-enhancing hypodense white matter lesions were highly suggestive, and the diagnosis was later confirmed by the detection of JC-virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's significant clinical improvement and immune recovery after starting antiretroviral therapy further support this diagnosis.",
  "disease_name_short": "Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy"
