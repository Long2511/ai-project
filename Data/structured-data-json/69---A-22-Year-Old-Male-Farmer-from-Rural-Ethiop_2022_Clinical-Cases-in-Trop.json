  "patient_information": "A 22-year-old male farmer from rural northern Ethiopia, who was previously in excellent health with no history of trauma or prodromal symptoms prior to the onset of his illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "Difficulty walking, which began 10 years prior to presentation.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's problem began 10 years ago when he woke from sleep with weakness in both legs. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, necessitating the use of a cane for mobility. The illness onset was not associated with back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms. His walking difficulty became permanent, preventing him from returning to farm work, and at age 20, he moved to the capital city.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a farmer from rural northern Ethiopia. The onset of his illness coincided with a period of drought and famine, during which his diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas (Lathyrus sativus, local name guaya). He was engaged in hard physical labor on his family farm. Several similar cases of weakness were reported among other young male farmers in his village. He migrated to the capital with another young male farmer from his village who had a similar condition. There was no history of cassava exposure.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "The patient is alert with a normal mental state. His gait is spastic ('scissor gait'), characterized by foot-dragging and toe-scraping. Examination revealed mild bilateral lower limb spastic weakness of a pyramidal pattern, with pathologically brisk deep tendon reflexes and sustained foot clonus. An extensor plantar response was present on the right and equivocal on the left. Cranial nerves and upper limbs were normal, and there was no sensory or bladder dysfunction.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count, liver and renal function tests, cerebrospinal fluid, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography were all normal. HIV-1 serology was non-reactive. HTLV-1 and -2 serology and MRI were not available.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The clinical syndrome is an upper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis. Compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies were considered less likely due to the absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level, or sphincter disturbance, along with normal labs and HIV-seronegativity. HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM) was deemed unlikely due to the acute onset, whereas HAM is typically insidious and progressive with sensory and bladder symptoms. Neurocassavism (konzo) was ruled out by the lack of cassava exposure. The patient's gender, pre-onset physical exertion, and excessive consumption of 'guaya' in a context of similar cases favored a toxico-nutritional disease.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received physiotherapy and muscle relaxants, which provided only mild, short-lasting improvement in his spasticity. He was provided with a walking cane and a wheelchair. He was also counseled to avoid any further consumption of Lathyrus sativus. The disability was permanent.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is neurolathyrism, a preventable toxic myelopathy. It is caused by the excessive and prolonged ingestion of the grass pea, Lathyrus sativus, which contains the neurotoxin β-ODAP. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical presentation of acute-onset, irreversible spastic paraparesis without sensory deficits, combined with a clear dietary history of consuming grass peas as a sole food source during a famine, a history of heavy physical exertion, and the epidemiological context of similar cases in his village. Other causes of myelopathy were ruled out by clinical features and normal laboratory investigations.",
