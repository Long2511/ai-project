  "patient_information": "A 24-year-old Dutch yoga instructor, described as a healthy-looking 'eco-traveller' with no immunosuppression. She has followed a strict vegan diet for the past 8 years.",
  "chief_complaint": "An episode of strange sensations on the right side of the body.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a single episode of 'pins and needles' sensations that started on the right side of her face, marched to her right arm, and then involved her right leg, lasting for about 2 minutes. This was consistent with a Jacksonian 'sensory march' or focal epileptic seizure. A similar episode had occurred several months prior, for which she did not seek medical attention.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Four years prior to presentation, the patient completed a 2-year backpacking trip through endemic regions in South America (Ecuador, Peru, Argentina) and South-east Asia (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia). During her travels, she stayed in hostels and with local people in the countryside. Her diet consisted of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and rice from local vendors, with no animal products. This history is relevant as neurocysticercosis is acquired by consuming food or water contaminated with Taenia solium eggs.",
  "vitals": "On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared well. Her neurological examination was completely unremarkable, and the rest of her physical examination was also normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Routine blood investigations, including differential blood count and C-reactive protein, were normal. The CSF examination was also unremarkable. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium enhancement revealed multiple cortical and subcortical cystic lesions in both hemispheres, some containing a scolex ('central dot'). Some lesions showed perifocal edema and ring-enhancement. The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) for anticysticercal antibodies in both serum and CSF.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary diagnosis considered was neurocysticercosis. This was based on the combination of a focal epileptic seizure, extensive travel history to endemic areas in South America and Asia, and characteristic neuroimaging findings of multiple cystic brain lesions in various stages (vesicular and colloidal), despite a normal physical exam and lack of systemic inflammation.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days and started on antiepileptic drugs. She declined adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. She remained seizure-free for over a year. A follow-up MRI at 1 year showed regression of all cysts, and a CT scan at 2 years showed two calcifications. Her antiepileptic medication was stopped after a seizure-free period of 3 years.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a focal seizure, characteristic MRI findings of multiple cystic cerebral lesions, and an epidemiological link through extensive travel in endemic regions. It was definitively confirmed by positive serology (EITB) in both serum and CSF.",
