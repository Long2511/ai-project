  "patient_information": "A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children. Notably, she was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programs were stopped in the early 1980s.",
  "chief_complaint": "A history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and neck swelling, followed by a disseminated skin rash.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient developed fever, malaise, headache, and a dry cough. Two days later, a disseminated skin rash appeared, beginning on her face and spreading centrifugally to her body, including the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. The skin lesions evolved from macules to papules, then vesicles, and finally to pustules. The oral lesions were painful, making it difficult to eat and drink.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in a rural agricultural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area where monkeypox is endemic. She is part of a population with waning herd immunity to orthopoxviruses, as she was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A specific animal or human contact was not identified, which is common in such settings.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed disseminated, uniform, umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, with a predilection for the face, hands, and feet. There was generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen, and central nervous system was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results at presentation included a White Blood Cell count of 4.4 x 10^9/L (73% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and an elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. The diagnosis was made clinically, as definitive laboratory testing such as PCR or culture is often unavailable in endemic regions.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses for this vesiculopustular rash included poxvirus infections. Monkeypox was the main suspicion due to the endemic location, rash characteristics, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Varicella was also considered but is less likely given the uniform stage of the lesions and palm/sole involvement. Cowpox was deemed unlikely as it usually presents with a single lesion and uncommonly causes significant fever or lymphadenopathy.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Management was exclusively supportive, as no specific treatment is available for monkeypox. The patient made an uneventful recovery but was left with scarring from the skin lesions.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is human monkeypox, made on clinical grounds. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile prodrome followed by a characteristic centrifugal, vesiculopustular rash with lesions in a uniform stage of development, including on the palms and soles. The presence of prominent lymphadenopathy and the patient's residence in an endemic area of the DRC further support this diagnosis over differentials like varicella. Her age indicates she was not vaccinated against smallpox, increasing her susceptibility.",
  "disease_name_short": "Human monkeypox"
