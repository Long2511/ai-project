  "patient_information": "A 28-year-old West African man from Ghana, described as short for an adult. He has a history of a previous ulcer on his right ankle some years ago which took about a year to heal.",
  "chief_complaint": "A painful, non-healing ulcer on his left ankle for the past 4 months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presents with a painful ulcer on his left ankle which has been present for 4 months and is not healing. There is no history of prior trauma. He reports a similar ulcer on his right ankle years prior that took a year to heal. He also complains of pain in his right thigh and in both knees.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a West African man living in Ghana. His occupation as a self-employed individual is noted as it made enforcing strict bed rest difficult. The case takes place in a setting where sickle cell disease is a common hereditary disorder.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs on presentation were: Temperature 36.6°C, pulse 88 bpm, and blood pressure 110/70 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient is short for an adult, pale, and has a tinge of jaundice. There is an ulcer on his left ankle, next to the medial malleolus, with surrounding hyperpigmentation. Tenderness is noted in both knee joints and in his right thigh. The rest of the physical examination is reported as normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of 17.6×10^9/L, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, adequate platelets, and a normal fasting blood glucose of 4.8 mmol/L. A peripheral blood film showed irreversibly sickled cells, polychromasia, target cells, and nucleated red cells. A sickling test was positive, and haemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed homozygous HbSS-type disease. A wound swab grew Pseudomonas species sensitive to levofloxacin. Radiography of the left leg showed a periosteal reaction with slightly sclerotic bones.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was for the chronic leg ulcer. A venous ulcer was considered, but the presence of bone pain, jaundice, and pallor pointed toward a haemolytic anaemia. Various hereditary haemolytic anaemias were considered, including haemoglobinopathies like thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, spherocytosis, and pyruvate kinase deficiency, with sickle cell disease being the most likely diagnosis in the West African context. Other possibilities included tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, chronic osteomyelitis, Buruli ulcer (usually painless), other mycobacterial infections, pyoderma gangrenosum, and malignant diseases.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was managed with alternate daily wound dressing using normal saline irrigation and povidone-iodine, along with systemic antibiotics for the Pseudomonas wound infection. His recurrent bone pain was managed with hydration, prompt treatment of infections, paracetamol, and tramadol. He also received daily folic acid supplementation. Strict bed rest was difficult to enforce. At 3 years follow-up, the ulcer was still not healed, and grafting was considered. Six years later, the ulcer remained unhealed as the patient could not afford a skin graft, though his WBC had normalized and his hemoglobin had slightly increased.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is sickle cell disease, specifically homozygous HbSS-type, complicated by a chronic ankle ulcer. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive sickling test and haemoglobin electrophoresis. The clinical presentation of a young West African man with pallor, jaundice, bone pain, and a history of chronic, non-healing leg ulcers is characteristic of the condition. Laboratory findings of anaemia and a peripheral smear with sickled red cells provided strong supporting evidence.",
