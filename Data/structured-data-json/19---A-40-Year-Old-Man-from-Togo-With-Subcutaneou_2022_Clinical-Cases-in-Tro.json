  "patient_information": "A 40-year-old man from Togo. No comorbidities or other past medical history were reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "Changes in both eyes over 4 years, painless bumps under the skin for two decades, and intense itching.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 40-year-old man presents with changes in both of his eyes over the past 4 years, currently without visual disturbances. He is concerned because many adults in his village have gone blind after showing similar eye features. He has also observed painless bumps developing under his skin over the past two decades. Additionally, he suffers from intense skin itching that is severe enough to disrupt his sleep at night.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient has spent his entire life in a village in the savannah of Togo, near a fast-flowing river. He reports the presence of common small biting flies in the area. The high prevalence of blindness among adults in his village suggests a hyperendemic setting for his condition.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "Examination reveals opacities in the corneas of both eyes, consistent with band-shaped sclerosing keratopathy (keratitis semilunaris). The skin shows atrophic areas with thinning and loss of elasticity, accompanied by multiple scratch marks. Firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter, are palpable over bony prominences such as the ribs, iliac crest, femoral trochanters, and on the head.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The diagnosis was considered typical and likely made on clinical grounds in a resource-limited setting. The text suggests potential investigations, including skin snips taken from the vicinity of a nodule to identify microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, and a slit-lamp examination to detect microfilariae in the anterior chamber and cornea. Serological tests for IgG4 responses to O. volvulus antigens (like Ov16) are also mentioned as a diagnostic option. It is not stated that these tests were performed for this patient.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis was onchocerciasis (river blindness), given the clinical triad of ocular changes, itchy dermatitis with skin atrophy, and subcutaneous nodules, along with a classic exposure history. Other possibilities for the subcutaneous nodules included lipomas and cysticercosis. The pruritic dermatitis could also be caused by scabies, HIV-associated pruritic eruptions, Mansonella streptocerca, yaws, leprosy, or mycotic infections.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with ivermectin (150 μg/kg) as a single dose, which was repeated after 3 months and again after 1 year. He also received a 6-week course of doxycycline 100 mg daily. The clinical outcome following this treatment was not described.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode *Onchocerca volvulus*. This diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic clinical triad of corneal opacities, chronic pruritic dermatitis with skin atrophy, and subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences. The diagnosis is further solidified by the patient's lifelong epidemiological exposure in a hyperendemic region of Togo known for fast-flowing rivers and biting *Simulium* blackflies. Although specific lab confirmation was not reported, the clinical and epidemiological picture is considered pathognomonic.",
