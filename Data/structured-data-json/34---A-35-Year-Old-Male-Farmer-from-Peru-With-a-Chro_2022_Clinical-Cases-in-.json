  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The patient was previously healthy.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 2-month history of a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on his left arm.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Two months before presentation, the patient suffered a scratch on his left hand from a tree branch while working. A few days later, a small painless erythematous papule appeared, which later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks, new pustules appeared, the lesion ulcerated and increased in size despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule, he noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. He was seen at a regional hospital and treated empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials but showed no improvement, leading to a referral.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The initial lesion was caused by a scratch from a tree branch while working in the fields. He denied recent contact with animals or travel.",
  "vitals": "The patient's vital signs are normal and he is afebrile.",
  "physical_exam": "On the left hand, there is a single ulcerative lesion (20 × 30 mm) with irregular elevated borders and multiple subcutaneous erythematous nodules (10 × 10 mm) along the lymphatic tract of the left arm. The rest of the physical examination is normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed a WBC of 4.5 × 10^9/L with a normal differential count and mild anaemia with a haemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL. A chest x-ray and PPD skin test were normal and negative, respectively. Direct microscopy for leishmania parasites and a leishmanin skin test were negative. Mycobacterial cultures were also negative. Definitive diagnosis was established when culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, and mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or M. marinum). Leishmaniasis was considered highly suggestive by the patient's origin and presentation, but the lack of response to a full course of pentavalent antimonials made it unlikely. Sporotrichosis was considered a top diagnosis due to the typical clinical features. Other causes like Nocardiosis and tularaemia were considered unlikely due to geographic rarity.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initial empiric treatments with antibiotics, topical traditional medicines, and a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials for suspected leishmaniasis all failed to produce improvement. Following the definitive diagnosis, the patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg/day orally. After 8 months of treatment, the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved, and the patient was considered cured.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. This was confirmed by the positive culture of S. schenckii from both ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration specimens. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic clinical syndrome of a primary ulcer with nodular lymphangitis (sporotrichoid spread) following traumatic inoculation with plant matter in an agricultural worker. Other key diagnoses like leishmaniasis and tuberculosis were ruled out by negative specific tests and, in the case of leishmaniasis, therapeutic failure.",
