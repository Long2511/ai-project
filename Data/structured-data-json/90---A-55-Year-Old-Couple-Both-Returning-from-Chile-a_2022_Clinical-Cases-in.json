  "patient_information": "A 55-year-old, previously healthy Swiss couple, both of whom are fitness instructors. No relevant comorbidities, immunosuppression, or allergies are mentioned.",
  "chief_complaint": "Acute febrile illness progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in two individuals, with onsets separated by three weeks, following return from travel in South America.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The husband developed fever (39°C), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland. He presented to the hospital 4 days later, still febrile and profoundly weak, and subsequently developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation requiring non-invasive ventilation. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints. She deteriorated rapidly over 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure, multi-organ failure with renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with profuse bleeding, necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mass transfusions.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The couple had travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile. During the last month of their trip, they spent time hiking, camping, and taking occasional mud baths in the Chile-Argentinian border region. The mode of transmission remained unclear, with both acquisition from a common environmental source (e.g., rodent excreta) and human-to-human transmission considered possible explanations for the three-week interval between their presentations.",
  "vitals": "Husband on presentation: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, temperature 39°C (102.2°F). Wife on admission: normal blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, with a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F).",
  "physical_exam": "On initial presentation, both patients had no abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation. The husband subsequently developed shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation. The wife later developed profuse bleeding from puncture sites consistent with coagulopathy.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "On admission, the husband's labs showed a WCC of 7.3 G/L with 35% band neutrophils, platelets of 48 G/L, and CRP of 68 mg/L. His respiratory pathogen panel and HIV test were negative. The wife's admission labs revealed a WCC of 1.88 G/L, platelets of 98 G/L, and CRP of 7 mg/L. Initial chest radiography was normal for both patients, but both subsequently developed extensive bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusions. Both patients were ultimately confirmed to be infected with Andesvirus (ANDV) by PCR and serology.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for ARDS after travel to South America included influenza and other common respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, and rickettsial diseases like spotted fever. Hantavirus was a key consideration due to the long incubation period and the possibility of human-to-human transmission explaining the 3-week gap between cases. Pulmonary plague, fungal infections, and severe malaria were also possibilities. Most other viral hemorrhagic fevers were considered less likely due to their shorter incubation periods.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The husband was treated in the ICU with non-invasive ventilation for 5 days and made a full recovery after a month of rehabilitation. The wife experienced a severe course, requiring nearly a full month of ECMO, renal replacement therapy, and mass transfusions. Her course was complicated by bleeding at ECMO insertion sites, leading to compartment syndrome and leg ischemia, requiring multiple surgical interventions and central ECMO placement. She also developed nosocomial infections and remained in the ICU for 5 months, followed by 12 months of rehabilitation.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) caused by Andesvirus (ANDV). The diagnosis was confirmed in both individuals by PCR and serology. The clinical presentation of a severe febrile prodrome followed by rapidly progressive ARDS, thrombocytopenia, and cardiorespiratory collapse was characteristic of HCPS. The travel history to an endemic region in Chile and Argentina provided the epidemiological link. The staggered presentation suggested either a common source exposure with different incubation times or human-to-human transmission, a known feature of Andesvirus.",
