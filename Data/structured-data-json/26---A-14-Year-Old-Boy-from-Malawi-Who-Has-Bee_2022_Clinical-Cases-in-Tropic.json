  "patient_information": "A 14-year-old Malawian boy.",
  "chief_complaint": "An extensive necrotic wound on his right foot, presenting three weeks after a snake bite.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient was bitten on the right leg by a snake. Shortly after the bite, he developed haemorrhagic bullae on the leg, bleeding from the gums, and extensive vomiting. He was taken to a traditional healer, after which the bleeding and vomiting settled. However, he then developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to the extensive necrotic wound seen on admission.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The bite occurred in Malawi while the boy was playing on a path through rocky grassland. The snake was described as brown with V-shaped black bands on its back, approximately one meter long, and it hissed loudly before biting. The discussion identifies this as characteristic of the African puff-adder (Bitis arietans), which is common in the African savannah and responsible for many serious bites.",
  "vitals": "On admission, the patient appeared weak and in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4°C, pulse was 126 bpm, blood pressure was 85/60 mmHg, and the respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "There was an extensive, foul-smelling necrosis affecting the right foot and ankle with exposed tendons. The right lower leg was swollen, and the patient was unable to bend the ankle. The inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged on the right side. His urine was clear, a rectal exam showed no signs of bleeding, there was no haemoptysis, and fundoscopy was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The 20-minute whole blood clotting test (WBCT20) was normal. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 19 ×10^9/L, haemoglobin of 9.5 mg/dL, and platelets of 60 ×10^9/L. Potassium was 4.2 mmol/L.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The diagnosis centered on snakebite envenomation. The specific snake was most likely an African puff-adder (Bitis arietans) due to the snake's description (V-shaped pattern, stout body) and its classic venom effects of massive local swelling, haemorrhagic bullae, and extensive necrosis. Saw-scaled vipers (Echis species) can cause similar symptoms, but the presentation strongly fit with a puff-adder bite. Mamba bites were considered less likely as they are less common and typically present with neurotoxicity.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Due to the three-week delay since the bite, antivenom was not deemed useful. The patient was treated for sepsis upon admission with broad-spectrum antibiotics, ventilatory support, and fluid resuscitation. He also received tetanus prophylaxis. The wound was managed surgically with several debridements followed by successful mesh-grafting. He did not develop severe local complications like compartment syndrome. The boy was discharged several weeks later with some residual functional impairment of his right foot, for which he was booked for outpatient physiotherapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was severe cytotoxic snakebite envenomation, complicated by secondary bacterial infection, sepsis, and extensive tissue necrosis. The causative agent was identified with high probability as the African puff-adder (Bitis arietans) based on the snake's description and the clinical syndrome of massive local tissue destruction. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of sepsis, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia weeks after the initial bite. Management focused on sepsis and surgical wound care rather than antivenom due to the delayed presentation.",
