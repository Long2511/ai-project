  "patient_information": "A 38-year-old European expatriate with an unremarkable previous medical history. He is married and reports sexual contact with his wife only. He denies any history of trauma.",
  "chief_complaint": "Progressive difficulty passing urine and constipation for the past 3 weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty passing urine, requiring increasing abdominal pressure to void, eventually only passing small amounts at a time. This was associated with increasing lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and around the genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. Over the past two months, he had unintentional weight loss of 8 kg and fatigue, which he attributed to stress, but without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noted reddish discoloration of his urine without painful micturition or fever. He also mentioned that walking 'did not feel normal' but could not elaborate. He reported no backache, weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a European expatriate living in a tertiary hospital in Malawi. He reports having swum regularly in Lake Malawi. Details regarding his recent visit to a local clinic and other specific exposures were initially missing.",
  "vitals": "On physical examination, he was described as having normal vital signs.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared healthy. General examination was normal except for a palpable bladder. The rectal examination revealed a low anal sphincter tone. The genital examination was normal. Neurological examination showed lively, symmetrical tendon reflexes in the legs without clonus or pathological plantar reflexes, and no other abnormalities.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Urine microscopy from a local clinic had identified Schistosoma haematobium eggs. At the tertiary hospital, a full blood count showed a normal WBC of 9 x 10^9/L but with a relative eosinophilia of 21.8% and an absolute eosinophil count of 1.15 x 10^9/L. ALT was slightly elevated, while creatinine and CRP were normal. HIV and VDRL tests were negative. Repeat urine and stool microscopy were normal. Schistosomiasis serology was not available. An abdominal ultrasound showed a large bladder residue. An MRI of the spinal cord revealed an enhancing 1 cm large lesion at the anterior aspect of the conus medullaris with associated high T2 signal edema extending up to the T9 level. The MRI also showed nodular thickening of the bladder wall.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis for a conus medullaris syndrome in this patient was spinal cord schistosomiasis. Other important infectious causes considered were spinal tuberculosis, a spinal abscess, and neurosyphilis. Malignancy, such as a tumor or metastases impinging on the conus medullaris, was also considered and needed to be ruled out.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient had previously been treated at a local clinic with praziquantel, ciprofloxacin, buscopan, and bisacodyl. At the tertiary hospital, he required urinary catheterization for 2 weeks. He was treated with a second course of praziquantel and a course of high-dose prednisolone, which was tapered off over 2 months. The patient made a full recovery and remained well at a 2-year follow-up.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Spinal cord schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma haematobium infection, presenting as a conus medullaris syndrome. The diagnosis was established based on the initial identification of S. haematobium eggs in the urine, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of an enhancing lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. Other conditions like tuberculosis and cancer were considered less likely.",
