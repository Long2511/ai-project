  "patient_information": "A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.",
  "vitals": "On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.",
