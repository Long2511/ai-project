  "patient_information": "A 14-year-old boy from rural Tanzania with an otherwise unremarkable medical history. He has three siblings, one of whom is similarly affected, while his parents are well. His diet for the two months preceding his illness was almost exclusively cassava.",
  "chief_complaint": "Difficulty in walking, with a sudden onset just over two years prior.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient had been well until over two years ago when his illness suddenly started while he was walking home from school. He noticed his legs began to feel heavy and started to tremble, causing difficulty walking and a tendency to fall over. Since that day, he has been unable to stand or walk unaided and now stands on his toes, dragging his legs with the aid of a stick. He denies any history of fever, pain, sensory symptoms, bladder or bowel symptoms, or any disease progression since the initial onset.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in a village in a rural area of northern Tanzania where the main staple food crop is cassava. For two months before his illness began, his diet consisted almost exclusively of cassava. Identical cases had occurred in his own and neighbouring villages around the same time, affecting one of his siblings and other children.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs were reported as normal; no specific values were provided.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient is well nourished with an unremarkable general examination. On neurological exam, he is fully orientated with normal higher mental function and cranial nerves, except for bilateral optic pallor noted on fundoscopy. His limbs show signs of spastic paraparesis with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees. Power in the legs is graded 3 to 4 out of 5, with knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors most affected. There is bilateral hypertonia, hyperreflexia, and sustained ankle clonus with extensor plantar responses. Sensation is intact. The arms are normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia. A lumbar lordosis with thoracic kyphoscoliosis is noticeable on standing.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Investigations were largely normal, including a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood glucose, and creatinine. Urine analysis was normal. Microscopy of urine and stool specimens showed no ova of Schistosoma species. HIV serology and VDRL were negative. The lumbar puncture was normal. Radiographs of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were also normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnosis included spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease), transverse myelitis, spinal cord infections like schistosomiasis, and spinal malignancy. However, these were considered unlikely due to the isolated motor neuron involvement without sensory or bladder symptoms, the absence of back pain, and the acute onset with no progression over two years. This led to the suspicion of a nutritional cause, specifically a tropical myeloneuropathy like konzo or lathyrism. Lathyrism was excluded as it typically occurs in Ethiopia, making konzo the most likely diagnosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Management is supportive as there is no cure for the resulting permanent spastic paraparesis. The majority of patients use a stick or crutches. Muscle relaxants have a limited role. The patient was considered for surgical assessment for his severe contractures, such as Achilles tendon lengthening. At follow-up examinations at 6 and 12 months, his condition was unchanged. He was not referred for surgery due to a lack of resources and the extent of the local epidemic. He continues to use a stick for his very restricted mobility and works as a shoe repairer.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is konzo, a distinct form of tropical spastic paraparesis. This diagnosis is based on the abrupt onset of a permanent, non-progressive, symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or bladder involvement. The cause is attributed to chronic high dietary exposure to cyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava, supported by the patient's history of an almost exclusively cassava-based diet and the occurrence of an epidemic of similar cases in his village. Other neurological conditions were effectively ruled out by the specific clinical features and normal laboratory and imaging results.",
