  "patient_information": "A 6-year-old boy from Malawi who is known to be HIV-positive but not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART).",
  "chief_complaint": "High fever, dyspnoea, dry cough, and impaired consciousness for three days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was admitted to the hospital with a three-day history of high fever, dyspnoea, and a dry cough. Upon presentation, he had an impaired level of consciousness. A fine maculopapular rash, not previously described, was noted to have appeared behind his ears and on his forehead. The rash subsequently covered his trunk, and skin scaling started over his chest within the next few days.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Malawi and was admitted to a Malawian Central Hospital. No other specific travel, vector, or environmental exposures are mentioned. He is immunocompromised due to untreated HIV infection.",
  "vitals": "Examination revealed a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and laboured breathing. His level of consciousness was impaired, with a Blantyre coma score of 3/5.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared to be a sick child with laboured breathing. He had coryza and bilateral conjunctivitis. Examination of the skin revealed a fine maculopapular rash behind both ears and on the forehead. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was also present. The rash later progressed to involve the trunk with subsequent skin scaling.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Malaria smears were performed upon admission and turned out to be negative. No other specific laboratory results were reported.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis was broad, including malaria, typhoid fever, atypical pneumonia, and various viral infections, particularly given the patient's immunosuppression. Measles was highly suspected due to the classic triad of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, combined with a rash starting behind the ears. Other considerations included rubella, enterovirus, infectious mononucleosis, scarlet fever, meningococcal disease, and rickettsial infections.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially started on presumptive antimalarial treatment, which was discontinued after malaria smears were confirmed negative. He required IV fluids, vitamin A for corneal protection, and was isolated due to being contagious. His course was complicated by the development of severe pneumonia, for which he received antibiotic treatment. After recovery from the acute illness, antiretroviral therapy was initiated in the outpatient clinic.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is measles. This is supported by the clinical presentation of a prodrome including the 'three Cs' (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis), followed by a characteristic maculopapular rash starting behind the ears and spreading downwards. The patient's HIV-positive status predisposed him to severe complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis (indicated by the low coma score). Malaria was excluded by negative smears, making measles the most likely diagnosis in this epidemiological context.",
  "disease_name_short": "Measles"
