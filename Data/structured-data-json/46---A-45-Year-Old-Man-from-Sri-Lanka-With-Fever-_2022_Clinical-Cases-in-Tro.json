  "patient_information": "A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man whose past medical history is unremarkable, but he admits to consuming locally brewed alcohol ('toddy') daily for the past 10 to 15 years. He was well before the current illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fever, chills, headache, body aches, and severe right hypochondrial pain for one week.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For the past week, the patient has experienced fever, chills, headache, body aches, and severe right hypochondrial pain. He also developed a dry cough in the past few days, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and is exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Sri Lanka and has a 10 to 15-year history of daily consumption of 'toddy', a locally brewed alcohol made from coconut flowers. The text notes that this specific alcoholic drink is locally known to be linked with amoebiasis, possibly through contamination of the clay containers used for collection. The case occurs in an Asian setting where amoebiasis, hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and melioidosis are endemic considerations.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, the temperature was 38.3°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared generally ill, mildly dehydrated, and in pain. There was no jaundice, pallor, or lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed a tender hepatomegaly, with the most prominent tenderness located over the 6th to 9th intercostal spaces in the right mid-axillary line. The spleen was not enlarged. Lung auscultation revealed a few inspiratory crackles over the right lung base. The cardiovascular and nervous systems were clinically normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory investigations revealed a leukocytosis (WBC 14.7 ×10^9/L), elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 48 mg/L), and abnormal liver function tests with a disproportionately elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP 446 U/L) and mildly elevated transaminases (AST 54 U/L, ALT 38 U/L). A chest radiograph showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm and patchy shadows in the right lower zone. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall measuring 7x6 cm in the right liver lobe, along with a small right-sided pleural effusion. Aspiration of the lesion yielded brownish pus.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was between an amoebic and a pyogenic liver abscess. An amoebic liver abscess was considered more likely given the epidemiological setting, the patient's age, lack of comorbidities, and the known association with 'toddy' consumption. Pyogenic abscess, particularly from hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae, was also a consideration due to its prevalence in Southeast Asia. Melioidosis was another differential, as it is endemic in Sri Lanka and can cause organ abscesses, with alcoholism being a risk factor. Infectious hepatitis was deemed less likely due to only slightly elevated transaminases and the absence of jaundice.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Due to its large size, the liver lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance. The patient was treated with metronidazole for ten days. He responded well to this management, making a rapid and uneventful recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is amoebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This was strongly suggested by the clinical picture of fever and right upper quadrant pain, physical findings of tender hepatomegaly and intercostal tenderness, and imaging showing a large, solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm. The diagnosis was further supported by the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus' (necrotic liver tissue) and the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy, a standard treatment for amoebiasis.",
