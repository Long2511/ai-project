  "patient_information": "An 18-year-old, right-handed man from India. He reports no family history of skin problems and is otherwise well.",
  "chief_complaint": "A pale patch on the right arm and forearm for 3 months, with associated numbness.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For the past 3 months, the patient has noticed a pale patch on his right arm and forearm. The lesion is not itchy or painful, but he reports reduced sensation in the affected area. He also complains of mild numbness affecting the little finger of his right hand, but experiences no weakness.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from India, a country where leprosy is endemic. No other specific exposures, such as to animals, water, or sick contacts, are mentioned.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "On the outer aspect of the right arm, extending to the forearm, there is a 20 cm by 10 cm hypopigmented macule with dry skin. Sensation within this area is reduced compared to normally pigmented skin. Both ulnar nerves are palpable, but the right ulnar nerve is thickened. There is also reduced sensation on the tip and ulnar border of the right little finger. The rest of the skin examination and neurological exam are normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "No additional investigations were performed as the diagnosis was made clinically based on cardinal signs. The case notes that if performed, a skin biopsy would likely show granulomatous dermatitis with destruction of cutaneous nerves, and a slit-skin smear would likely be negative.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis included common causes of hypopigmentation such as pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor, and seborrheic dermatitis. However, the presence of a hypopigmented anaesthetic patch is a cardinal sign of leprosy. The combination of this skin lesion with signs of a neuropathy (thickened ulnar nerve) strongly raised the suspicion of leprosy over other dermatological conditions.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was diagnosed with paucibacillary leprosy and was started on a 6-month course of rifampicin and dapsone. The associated sensory neuropathy was treated with oral prednisolone 30 mg daily, tapered monthly. The patient was counseled about the disease, advised on hand care, and reassured that he was not an infection risk. His family and friends were examined and showed no signs of leprosy. He made a full recovery.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is paucibacillary leprosy. This clinical diagnosis was established based on the presence of two cardinal signs: a hypopigmented skin lesion with definite sensory loss, and a thickened peripheral nerve (the right ulnar nerve). According to the WHO classification, having five or fewer skin patches categorizes the disease as paucibacillary.",
