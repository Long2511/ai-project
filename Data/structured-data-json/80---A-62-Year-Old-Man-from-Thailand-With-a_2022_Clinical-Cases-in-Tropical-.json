  "patient_information": "A 62-year-old male Thai police sergeant major from Kalasin Province in northeast Thailand. His past medical history, obtained after surgery, includes a liver fluke infection treated with praziquantel within the last 10 years. Hepatitis serology suggests a resolved previous Hepatitis B infection.",
  "chief_complaint": "Incidental finding of a solitary liver mass on abdominal ultrasonography during an annual physical check-up.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented for a routine annual physical check-up and was found to have a solitary liver mass on abdominal ultrasonography. He was completely asymptomatic, denying any clinical symptoms, weight loss, jaundice, or other gastrointestinal issues. He was referred to a hospital for further investigation and treatment.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Kalasin Province in northeast Thailand, a region where traditional food often includes raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing metacercariae of the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. This exposure is a known risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. The patient had a confirmed history of liver fluke infection.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs were reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared in good health on physical examination. There was no jaundice, palpable liver or spleen, or any detected liver stigmata or lymphadenopathy.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed normal liver function tests (AST 26 U/L, ALT 32 U/L, ALP 84 U/L) and bilirubin levels. Viral markers were negative for active hepatitis B (HBsAg negative) and hepatitis C (Anti-HCV negative), though anti-HBc was positive, suggesting past infection. Tumor markers revealed a normal AFP (2.8 U/mL), an elevated CEA (18.96 µg/L), and a markedly elevated CA19-9 (342.80 U/mL). Abdominal MRI confirmed a single solid liver mass in the right liver lobe (segments VI/VII).",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a metastatic tumour, and infections like tuberculosis. In an asymptomatic patient with a high serum CA19-9 level and no signs of chronic viral hepatitis, CCA was considered the most likely diagnosis, while metastatic cancer required investigation to find a primary site.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a hemihepatectomy. A large (9 x 9 cm) whitish-yellowish tumour was resected from the right liver lobe. During the procedure, liver flukes (O. viverrini) were found in the adjacent bile duct. The liver parenchyma appeared non-cirrhotic. Postoperatively, the patient was started on chemotherapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). This was confirmed by histology of the resected tumor, which showed infiltrative compact glandular structures lined by dysplastic columnar cells. The diagnosis is strongly associated with chronic infection by the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, which was confirmed by the direct visualization of the parasites in the bile duct during surgery, the patient's residential history in an endemic area, and the markedly elevated CA19-9 tumor marker.",
