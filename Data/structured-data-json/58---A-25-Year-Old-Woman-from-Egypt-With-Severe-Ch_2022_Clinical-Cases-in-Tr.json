  "patient_information": "A 25-year-old woman from Bani Suwaif in Upper Egypt. No pre-existing comorbidities were reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "Severe diarrhoea for 2 months accompanied by significant weight loss (15 kg) and amenorrhoea.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness. The patient's positive response to albendazole therapy further supports the diagnosis.",
