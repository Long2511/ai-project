  "patient_information": "A 24-year-old man of Turkish origin residing in Germany. He was diagnosed with cystic echinococcosis (CE) three years prior to the current presentation based on imaging and positive serology for Echinococcus granulosus.",
  "chief_complaint": "Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presents with acute right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Three years earlier, he had a similar episode of pain, which led to the discovery of two calcified cystic liver lesions via ultrasound and CT scan. Serology at that time was positive for Echinococcus granulosus, confirming cystic echinococcosis. As the cysts were calcified and the patient was asymptomatic, he refused the offered surgical treatment and was instead monitored regularly with ultrasound.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient visits his family in rural eastern Turkey (Anatolia) annually for about six weeks. Provenance from a hyperendemic region is the single most important risk factor for cystic echinococcosis, which is caused by the ingestion of eggs from the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 64 bpm, and temperature was 36°C (96.8°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was in fair general condition with scleral jaundice. Abdominal examination revealed right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness without guarding.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The full blood count was normal. Liver function tests showed a cholestatic pattern with elevated AST (145 U/L), ALT (454 U/L), GGT (394 U/L), ALP (402 U/L), and total bilirubin (120 µmol/L). Inflammatory markers were elevated with a CRP of 49 mg/L. Imaging from 3 years prior showed two calcified cystic lesions in the liver (a 7x6 cm WHO CE3b cyst and a 5x4 cm WHO CE1 cyst). On the current admission, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) demonstrated biliary obstruction from a cystobiliary fistula, with cyst content found within the common bile duct.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Differential diagnoses for cystic liver lesions in this patient included a congenital simple hepatic cyst, pseudocysts from alveolar echinococcosis, infectious causes like bacterial or amoebic abscesses, tuberculoma, and benign or malignant tumors. However, the patient's known history and positive serology made a complication of cystic echinococcosis the most likely diagnosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient's biliary obstruction was managed with a therapeutic ERC, during which cyst content was removed from the common bile duct. His associated cholangitis was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. After the acute inflammation settled, he underwent partial cystectomy for both cysts. The patient has been followed for nine years after surgery with no evidence of recurrence and is considered cured.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is complicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis, caused by the larval form of *Echinococcus granulosus*. The patient presented with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis secondary to a cystobiliary fistula, a known complication of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by finding cyst material in the common bile duct during an ERC procedure, in the context of a known history of CE with positive serology and characteristic imaging findings.",
