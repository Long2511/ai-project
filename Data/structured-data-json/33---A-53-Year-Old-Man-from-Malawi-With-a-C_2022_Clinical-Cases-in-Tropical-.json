  "patient_information": "A 53-year-old Malawian man, who is a non-smoker with an unremarkable past medical history. He was newly diagnosed with HIV infection and found to have advanced immunosuppression, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL.",
  "chief_complaint": "Productive cough for 3 months with associated night sweats and weight loss.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of productive cough with whitish sputum, night sweats, and unquantified weight loss. Two months prior, he sought care for the same complaints and was treated with presumptive antimalarials and a 5-day course of amoxicillin, with no improvement in his symptoms. He is not on any regular medication.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a subsistence farmer in Malawi. He reports no known tuberculosis (TB) contacts and has no history of working in mines or the construction industry. He is married with five children, who are all well.",
  "vitals": "On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 88 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared slightly wasted and mildly anaemic. Examination of the mouth revealed no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma, or oral hairy leukoplakia. His chest was clear to auscultation, and heart sounds were normal without murmurs. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the liver and spleen were not enlarged.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "The HIV test was reactive, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL. Laboratory results showed leukopenia (WBC 3.2 x 10^9/L) and anemia (Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), with normal platelets. Two sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, as were a Malaria RDT and a thick smear for Plasmodium spp. A chest radiograph on admission showed a prominent hilar region bilaterally but was otherwise normal. Induced sputum was also negative for AFB, and sputum PCR was not available.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The most likely diagnosis was smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's HIV-positive status with advanced immunosuppression, chronic constitutional symptoms, and lack of response to antibiotics. Other considerations included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a bacterial chest infection, and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, although the latter was less likely without cutaneous or mucosal lesions. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) was also considered.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole, but his fever persisted. On hospital day 7, he was started on empirical treatment for smear-negative TB with a four-drug regimen (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). After one week of antituberculous therapy, he began to feel better, his fever resolved, and the cough gradually settled. Three weeks into his TB treatment, he was started on antiretroviral therapy.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with advanced HIV infection. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, and fever in a severely immunosuppressed individual (CD4 count 54), which is a common presentation for TB in this setting. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's prompt clinical response to empirical antituberculous treatment after failing to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Negative sputum smears and non-specific radiographic findings (hilar prominence) are typical for HIV-associated TB.",
