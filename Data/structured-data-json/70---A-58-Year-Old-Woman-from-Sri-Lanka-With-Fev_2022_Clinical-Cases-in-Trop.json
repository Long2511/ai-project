  "patient_information": "A 58-year-old woman from a rural area in Sri Lanka. No relevant comorbidities, immunosuppression, or allergies are mentioned.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 10-day history of high-grade fever, chills, body aches, cough, and shortness of breath, complicated by recent onset of tinnitus, hearing loss, and increasing confusion.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 10-day illness characterized by high-grade fever, chills, body aches, non-productive cough, and progressive shortness of breath. Two days before admission, she developed tinnitus and hearing loss. In the 24 hours prior to admission, she became increasingly confused.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in a rural area of Sri Lanka, an endemic region for scrub typhus. A crater-like lesion (eschar) was later found in her right axilla, consistent with the bite of an infected trombiculid mite (chigger), the vector for Orientia tsutsugamushi.",
  "vitals": "On admission, the patient's temperature was 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate was 120 bpm, and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was confused with severely impaired hearing (WHO grade 3). There were enlarged axillary lymph nodes on the right side. Lungs had scattered crackles at the bases. The liver was enlarged to 5 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen was just palpable. No rash or neck stiffness was present. A later examination on day 2 revealed a well-demarcated, crater-like eschar hidden in the right axilla.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Admission labs showed a normal WBC, mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98 x 10^9/L), elevated AST (74 U/L) and ALT (68 U/L), and elevated creatinine (123.8 µmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (35 cells/µL, 80% lymphocytes) with elevated protein (0.64 g/L). Blood cultures, Leptospira and Salmonella serologies, and a thick film for malaria were all negative. A chest radiograph and brain CT scan were normal, while an EEG showed widespread slowing. The diagnosis was supported by a high Orientia tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre of >1:4096.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses for this undifferentiated febrile illness included scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, and malaria. The clinical triad of fever, deafness, and confusion in a patient from this region strongly suggested scrub typhus. Malaria was excluded by a negative thick film, while serologies for Leptospira and Salmonella were also negative.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "On the second day of admission, the patient's neurological status deteriorated with worsening confusion (GCS 8) and development of coarse tremors and saccadic eye oscillations. After an eschar was found, doxycycline therapy was commenced. The patient improved significantly within 48 hours and was discharged on day 6. Her hearing returned to normal, and she had no residual neurological deficits.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is scrub typhus, caused by infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation (fever, confusion, deafness), epidemiological risk (rural Sri Lanka), key physical finding of an eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confirmation with a high specific IFA-IgG antibody titre (>1:4096). Alternative diagnoses were ruled out by negative laboratory testing.",
