  "patient_information": "A 7-year-old girl from South Sudan, described as severely malnourished with a Z-score less than -3. She has never been admitted to a hospital before the current illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 4-week history of undulating fever.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient's uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).",
  "vitals": "On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative. An initial visceral leishmaniasis rK39-antibody RDT was also negative. However, a subsequent Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis was positive with a high titre (≥1:6,400).",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient's condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient's positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.",
