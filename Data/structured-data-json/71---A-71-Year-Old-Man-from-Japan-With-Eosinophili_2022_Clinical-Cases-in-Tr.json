  "patient_information": "A 71-year-old Japanese man, who is clinically well and asymptomatic. He was born and currently resides in the Kyushu district of southern Japan. He reports no history of traveling overseas.",
  "chief_complaint": "Referral for work-up of a nodular lesion in the right lung found on routine health monitoring.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient has been asymptomatic. A lung lesion was first detected as a linear shadow on a routine health check two years prior. He has been under regular follow-up since then. On a recent follow-up visit, chest radiography and CT scan revealed that the linear shadow had transformed into a nodular lesion approximately 2 cm in diameter in the right lung.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in the Kyushu district of southern Japan, an area where Paragonimus species are endemic. He has no history of international travel. Specific dietary exposures, such as consumption of raw freshwater crabs or wild boar meat, were considered as risk factors for paragonimiasis but not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.",
  "vitals": "The vital signs were reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "The chest was clear, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count showed a white blood cell count of 6.5 x 10^9/L with eosinophilia (8.3%, absolute count 0.54 x 10^9/L). Liver function, renal function, electrolytes, LDH, and CRP were all normal. Total IgE was elevated at 185.7 U/mL. Serologies for Cryptococcus Ag, Aspergillus Ag, and tuberculosis (QuantiFERON test) were negative. A multiple-dot ELISA was later found to be strongly positive for P. westermani. Imaging via FDG-PET-CT showed increased FDG uptake in the right upper lobe lesion. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology was negative for malignant cells and acid-fast bacilli.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for the nodular lung lesion included pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, which are primary considerations for such lesions. Systemic endemic mycoses were considered but deemed unlikely as they are not endemic in East Asia and the patient had no travel history. Given the patient's eosinophilia, elevated IgE, and origin from an endemic area, pulmonary helminth infection, specifically lung fluke infection (paragonimiasis), was strongly suspected.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with oral praziquantel at a dose of 25 mg/kg three times a day for three consecutive days. Following treatment, the lung lesion gradually faded and eventually disappeared. The patient's serum antibody titre for P. westermani also declined, indicating a successful therapeutic response.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is pulmonary paragonimiasis caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus westermani. This was established based on the combination of peripheral eosinophilia, elevated total IgE, origin from an endemic region in Japan, and a strongly positive multiple-dot ELISA for P. westermani. The diagnosis was further solidified by the complete resolution of the lung nodule and a decline in antibody titers following treatment with praziquantel. Alternative diagnoses like malignancy and tuberculosis were effectively ruled out by negative bronchoscopy, cytology, and specific serological tests.",
