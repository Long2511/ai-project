  "patient_information": "The patient is a 20-year-old housewife, a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.",
  "vitals": "On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.",
