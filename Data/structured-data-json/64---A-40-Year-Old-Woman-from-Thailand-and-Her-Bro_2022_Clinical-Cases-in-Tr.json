  "patient_information": "A 40-year-old Thai woman, a housewife who has lived in Germany for the past 13 years, with an unremarkable past medical history. She presented to an outpatient clinic in Germany.",
  "chief_complaint": "Severe headache for the past 8 days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reported an 8-day history of severe, gradual-onset headache that did not respond to painkillers. She denied fever, chills, visual problems, limb weakness, or memory problems. Three days earlier, she had presented to a municipal hospital where a CT scan of her brain and a blood count were both normal. Her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared meals while traveling, also developed a severe headache.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Ten days prior to presentation, the patient returned from a 4-week journey to north-east Thailand, where she visited friends and relatives. During her visit, she ate traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. The occurrence of similar symptoms in her brother-in-law after sharing meals suggests a common source outbreak.",
  "vitals": "On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed a supple neck and a negative Lasègue's sign. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, with no cranial nerve palsies. The remainder of the neurological examination was unremarkable, including higher cortical functions. There was no rash, oral thrush, subcutaneous swellings, lymphadenopathy, or enlargement of the liver and spleen. The cardiopulmonary examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (WBC 12.3 x 10⁹/L) with marked peripheral eosinophilia (2.34 x 10⁹/L) and an elevated IgE of 944 U/mL. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 34 cmH2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 1877 leukocytes/µL with 42% eosinophils, elevated protein at 1.59 g/L, and low glucose at 1.85 mmol/L. CSF microscopy, cultures, and antigen tests for bacteria and fungi were negative. After discharge, serology results came back positive, with a Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD antigen of Angiostrongylus cantonensis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The presumptive diagnosis was a food-borne parasitic infection causing eosinophilic meningitis, supported by the travel history, dietary exposure, and peripheral eosinophilia. The main differential diagnoses for eosinophilic meningitis considered included fungal infections, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Other parasitic causes such as neurocysticercosis, fascioliasis, and paragonimiasis were ruled out by negative serologies.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient underwent repeated lumbar punctures, which relieved her headache. She was prescribed iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia but received no specific antiparasitic treatment. After a one-week hospital stay, she was discharged significantly improved. At a 4-week follow-up, she had fully recovered, and her peripheral eosinophil count had returned to normal.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis due to infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis. This is supported by the clinical presentation of severe headache, the exposure history involving consumption of potential intermediate hosts like snails or frogs in an endemic region, and laboratory findings of marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot test showing specific antibodies against the 31kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen.",
  "disease_name_short": "Angiostrongyliasis"
