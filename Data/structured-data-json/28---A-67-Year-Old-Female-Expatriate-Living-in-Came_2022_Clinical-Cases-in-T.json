  "patient_information": "A 67-year-old German woman who has lived as an expatriate in Cameroon for the past 4 years. Her past medical history is noted to be otherwise unremarkable.",
  "chief_complaint": "Presentation with palpitations and a report of transient subcutaneous swellings over the past year.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reports palpitations and transient subcutaneous swellings over the past year, with no history of fever or constitutional symptoms. A 24-hour ECG recording performed elsewhere showed paroxysmal supraventricular extrasystoles. An initial echocardiogram revealed a minimal pericardial effusion.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient has resided as an expatriate in Cameroon, a region in West/Central Africa endemic for loiasis, for the past 4 years.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs were reported as normal and the patient was afebrile.",
  "physical_exam": "On physical examination, the patient's heart sounds were clear and regular with no murmurs. There were no visible subcutaneous swellings or other pathological findings noted.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial full blood count showed eosinophilia with an eosinophil percentage of 14% and an absolute eosinophil count of 0.868 x10^9/L. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. Serology for filarial infections was positive. Examination of a Giemsa-stained day-blood sample revealed sheathed microfilariae with a tapered tail, characteristic of Loa loa, with a microfilarial count of 1400/mL.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnoses considered for the combination of skin swellings and eosinophilia included non-specific urticaria, loiasis (Calabar swellings), cysticercosis, larva currens from Strongyloides infection, and Mansonella perstans infection. Acute schistosomiasis was deemed less likely due to the patient's afebrile state and the nature of the swellings. Gnathostomiasis and sparganosis were also considered but are less common in Africa.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated cautiously, first with albendazole and then with ivermectin. The therapy was well tolerated. Post-treatment, the absolute eosinophil count returned to normal, the microfilarial count declined, and the palpitations resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram 3 months later was normal, showing resolution of the pericardial effusion, and a repeat 24-hour ECG was also normal.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The diagnosis is Loiasis caused by the filarial nematode *Loa loa*. This was confirmed by the identification of sheathed microfilariae with tapered tails characteristic of the species in a day-blood sample, with a count of 1400/mL. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical triad of transient subcutaneous swellings, peripheral eosinophilia, and a compatible exposure history from living in Cameroon for 4 years. The patient's cardiac manifestations, including palpitations and a minimal pericardial effusion, resolved following anti-filarial treatment.",
