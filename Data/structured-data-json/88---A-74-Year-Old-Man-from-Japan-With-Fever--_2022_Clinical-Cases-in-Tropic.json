  "patient_information": "A 74-year-old Japanese man with a past medical history of cerebral infarction without neurological sequelae, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He is on treatment with an antiplatelet, an antihypertensive, and subcutaneous injections of the TNF-alpha blocker adalimumab once every two weeks.",
  "chief_complaint": "A five-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 5-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea. Upon arrival at the hospital, he was noted to be unwell, drowsy, and in respiratory distress, with impaired consciousness.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in a suburb of a city in the Kyushu district of south-western Japan. He is retired and engages in grape farming occasionally. He has opportunities to encounter wild animals such as boars and deer. He has no recent history of overseas travel. The differential diagnosis considers tick- and mite-borne diseases endemic to Japan due to his lifestyle and habitat.",
  "vitals": "On examination, his body temperature was 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse rate was 101 bpm, blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute. His SpO2 was 96% while receiving 7L of oxygen.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared unwell and drowsy, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13/15 (E3V4M6). Livedo reticularis was present bilaterally on his lower extremities, but no other rash was seen. His left inguinal lymph node was enlarged, and his chest examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory results showed a normal WBC of 5.3 x 10^9/L, thrombocytopenia with platelets at 90 x 10^9/L, and elevated liver and muscle enzymes: AST 413 U/L, ALT 95 U/L, LDH 1025 U/L, and CK 7442 U/L. The C-reactive protein (CRP) was low at 0.1 mg/dL. A blood sample sent to a reference laboratory returned positive for SFTS virus by PCR. During the hospital course, his platelet count nadired at 65 x 10^9/L on day 4 before recovering.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis included sepsis from causes like pneumonia or meningitis, given the acute fever and impaired consciousness. However, considering the patient's lifestyle in Kyushu, tick- and mite-borne diseases were also highly suspected, specifically Japanese spotted fever, scrub typhus, and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). SFTS was considered most likely due to the combination of acute fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated CK, with a low CRP being more suggestive of SFTS than rickettsioses.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was immediately intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He was started on meropenem and vancomycin for possible bacterial sepsis. After the SFTS virus PCR returned positive, antibiotics were discontinued. Despite supportive care, he developed worsening respiratory status and protracted hypotension requiring noradrenaline and hydrocortisone for non-responsive septic shock. His platelet count dropped to a low of 65 x 10^9/L on day 4 but subsequently recovered, and his CK level normalized by day 7. He showed gradual improvement, was extubated on day 12, and was discharged on day 35 without any sequelae.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR test on a blood sample. The clinical presentation of high fever, impaired consciousness, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated liver and muscle enzymes (AST, LDH, CK), and exposure risk in an endemic area of Japan strongly supported the diagnosis. A low CRP helped differentiate it from bacterial or rickettsial infections, which were ruled out.",
