  "patient_information": "A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.",
  "chief_complaint": "Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.",
  "vitals": null,
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.",
