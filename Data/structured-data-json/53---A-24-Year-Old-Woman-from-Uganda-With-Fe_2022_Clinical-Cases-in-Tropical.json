  "patient_information": "A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 5-day history of a febrile illness.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.",
  "disease_name_short": "Marburg virus disease"
