  "patient_information": "A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs were reported as normal.",
  "physical_exam": "General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.",
