  "patient_information": "A 33-year-old male refugee from Afghanistan with no other reported comorbidities. All medical documents were lost during his journey.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 6-month history of recurrent fever, night sweats, and progressive back pain.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reports a 6-month history of recurrent fever, night sweats, and progressive back pain. His illness began while living in a refugee camp in Iran, where he was treated with tablets and intragluteal injections for several weeks. His symptoms subsided during treatment but recurred after it ended. He subsequently traveled through Turkey and Eastern Europe before arriving in Germany 4 months prior to presentation.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a refugee from Afghanistan, a country highly endemic for brucellosis. He lived in a refugee camp in Iran before traveling through Turkey and Eastern Europe to Germany. The primary differential diagnosis was based on epidemiology relevant to his country of origin.",
  "vitals": "At presentation, the patient was afebrile and in fair general condition with normal vital signs, despite a history of recurrent fever.",
  "physical_exam": "Physical examination revealed marked spinal tenderness in the lumbar region. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory tests showed normal differential blood count, liver and renal function, and LDH. Inflammatory markers were slightly raised, with a C-reactive protein of 26 mg/L and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/hour. Urinalysis was unremarkable. An MRI of the spine revealed signal enhancement of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies, the corresponding disc, and the right psoas muscle, with disc space narrowing, consistent with spondylodiscitis of L3/L4. A chest x-ray showed no abnormalities and an echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis. Several blood cultures and sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli were negative. A CT-guided biopsy of the vertebral lesion was performed, and culture of the tissue sample grew Brucella melitensis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses for infectious spondylitis in this patient were tuberculosis and spinal brucellosis, which can be equally common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan. Other considerations included pyogenic spondylitis from pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella species. Less common causes like histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, and melioidosis were also possibilities depending on epidemiology.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was diagnosed with complicated brucellosis and treated with a prolonged course of antimicrobial combination therapy. The regimen consisted of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and rifampicin 900 mg daily for 16 weeks, with intramuscular streptomycin 1 g daily for the first 3 weeks. His fever subsided after several days, and inflammatory markers normalized several weeks after starting therapy. A follow-up MRI at the end of treatment showed full resolution of the paravertebral abscess. One year after completing treatment, the patient showed no signs of relapse.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is complicated brucellosis with spondylitis and paravertebral abscess formation. The causative agent, Brucella melitensis, was definitively identified by culture from a CT-guided vertebral tissue biopsy. The diagnosis was supported by the patient's epidemiology as a refugee from Afghanistan, clinical presentation of chronic fever and back pain, and MRI findings. Tuberculosis, a key differential, was less likely given the negative sputum smears and the positive culture for Brucella.",
