  "patient_information": "A 31-year-old Guatemalan man with no past medical history. He was born and lived in a rural area of Guatemala before immigrating to New York 5 years prior to presentation.",
  "chief_complaint": "Acute weakness and numbness of the leg, lasting several minutes.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with several minutes of weakness and numbness of the leg, which resolved just before his arrival at the hospital, consistent with a transitory ischemic attack. Two weeks previously, he had experienced two episodes of facial twitching, each lasting about 10 seconds and subsiding without intervention.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lived in a rural area of Guatemala until 5 years ago. While in Guatemala, his family owned uncorralled pigs and his home did not have sanitation services. These are significant epidemiological risk factors for cysticercosis.",
  "vitals": "Vital signs on presentation were normal.",
  "physical_exam": "On clinical examination, cranial nerves were intact, and motor and sensory examinations were normal. Deep tendon reflexes and gait were also normal. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial cell blood count and serum chemistry were within normal limits. A serum immunoblot for cysticercosis from the CDC was positive, and the serum cysticercosis antigen was also positive at the beginning of therapy. Imaging included a head CT which demonstrated multiple calcifications in the brain parenchyma. An MRI of the head revealed dilation of the suprasellar and Sylvian cisterns, peripheral enhancement after gadolinium administration, fluid-filled septated cystic lesions surrounding the proximal middle cerebral arteries, and an old lacunar infarct. A CT angiography showed patent cerebral arteries. An MRI of the spine did not show evidence of spinal involvement.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary diagnosis considered was neurocysticercosis, specifically the subarachnoid form (SANCC). This was strongly suggested by the combination of epidemiological risk factors (originating from an endemic area with pig contact and poor sanitation), a clinical presentation of transient neurological events (facial twitching, TIA), and characteristic imaging findings of parenchymal calcifications and complex subarachnoid cysts.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with a high dose of prednisone followed by a taper, along with dual antiparasitic therapy using albendazole and praziquantel. After 9 months of treatment, his serum antigen became negative, and his lesions resolved on follow-up imaging. He has been followed closely and has had no recurrence of symptoms.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC), caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium. This was confirmed by a positive serum immunoblot for cysticercosis. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's epidemiological history from rural Guatemala, the clinical presentation of transient neurological deficits, and extensive neuroimaging findings including parenchymal calcifications, subarachnoid cysts, and evidence of a prior lacunar infarct. The patient's positive response to antiparasitic and steroid therapy further solidifies the diagnosis.",
