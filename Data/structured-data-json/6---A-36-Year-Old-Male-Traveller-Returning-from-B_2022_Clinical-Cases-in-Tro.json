  "patient_information": "A 36-year-old male restaurant owner, who is married. HIV antibody testing was negative. He has no other reported significant medical history.",
  "chief_complaint": "A mobile, itchy mass under the skin, which has been migrating for three weeks.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Three weeks ago, the patient first noted a mass in his groin that subsided after four days. He then developed an itchy, serpiginous rash that tracked from his groin to his chest, moved over several days, and then disappeared. The mass subsequently reappeared on his right shoulder, prompting him to seek assessment. There was no history of fever or systemic illness.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Five weeks prior to presentation, the patient returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. During the trip, he swam in fresh river water and ate freshwater fish from the river, which he later admitted included making sushi. Two of the four friends who accompanied him had the same complaint. The patient took malaria chemoprophylaxis and slept under a mosquito net. He denies any sexual contact on the trip.",
  "vitals": "The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Organ system examination was normal. On his right upper deltoid, there was a firm mass with clear margins, measuring 3 x 8 cm. A serpiginous tract was visible, and the mass had reportedly migrated recently across his upper chest wall. There was no additional rash and no lymphadenopathy.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed a total white cell count of 8.9 ×10^9/L and a significant peripheral eosinophilia with an eosinophil count of 0.9 × 10^9/L (reference <0.5). Liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. HIV antibody testing was negative. Serology for Gnathostoma was negative.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential was gnathostomiasis, given the classic presentation of a mobile subcutaneous mass, creeping eruption, and eosinophilia. Other parasitic causes were considered, including Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), which was deemed unlikely as it is not endemic to the exposure area and has a longer incubation period. Sparganosis, another cause of migratory swelling, was considered very rare. Cutaneous larva migrans from hookworms and Strongyloides were also considered less likely as they typically cause fine tracks, not a large mobile mass.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous gnathostomiasis was made, and treatment was initiated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 21 days and a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg. During the first six days of treatment, the lesion migrated over his shoulder and neck, disappeared for 24 hours, then reappeared between his eyebrows, moved to his forehead and face, and was felt inside his nose. On the sixth day, the patient expressed a larva from his nostril, which was identified as Gnathostoma spinigerum. His two symptomatic friends were also treated and had full resolution of their symptoms.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is cutaneous gnathostomiasis caused by the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum. This was confirmed by the direct identification of the larva after it was expressed from the patient's nostril. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical syndrome of a migratory subcutaneous mass (larva migrans profundus), significant eosinophilia, and a history of consuming raw freshwater fish in an endemic area (Botswana). The initial negative serology does not rule out the disease, which was proven parasitologically.",
