  "patient_information": "A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months. He has a family history of allergy. He had previously kept bees and been stung frequently without ill effect, but 9 months prior to admission, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed an asthmatic attack that resolved spontaneously.",
  "chief_complaint": "Florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, and a feeling of impending death.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient reported a suspected tick bite on his ankle two days before presenting. Twenty-four hours later, he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He was seen at a clinic where a malaria blood film was negative and was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash and subsequently became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient, an expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months, was walking in the countryside two days before his illness began. A more specific exposure was later identified: a visit to a national game park two weeks before his illness, where he suffered numerous painful bites from tsetse flies.",
  "vitals": "On admission, his vital signs were: temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg. On day 3, he developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39°C.",
  "physical_exam": "On initial examination, the patient was clammy, in a state of collapse, with a widespread urticarial rash, respiratory distress, and stridor. Chest auscultation revealed expiratory wheezes. A painless, indurated, circumscribed swelling was noted on the inside of his left ankle. On day 3 of admission, the urticaria, stridor, and wheezing resolved, replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash, a slightly puffy face, and a bad headache.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 17.4 d/dL, a white cell count of 6.1 G/L (85% polymorphs), and an ESR of 5 mm/hour. A blood film for malaria parasites, chest radiograph, and stool and urine microscopy were all negative. On day 3, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. A lumbar puncture performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The initial diagnosis was anaphylactic shock, presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (like acute schistosomiasis), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease, though the absence of eosinophilia was noted. After the clinical picture changed on day 3, with fever, headache, and a new rash, trypanosomiasis was suspected.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initially treated for anaphylactic shock with intramuscular adrenaline, with good effect. He was admitted and received intermittent IM adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistamines for two days. After the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was confirmed on day 3, he was treated with a full course of suramin, totaling 5.75g, starting with a test dose. His urine was monitored weekly during treatment and showed transient protein, casts, and white cells, which resolved after treatment finished.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis, likely caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. Although the initial presentation was an atypical anaphylactic shock, the subsequent development of fever, headache, an erythematous rash, and the recognition of a trypanosomal chancre at the bite site led to the correct diagnosis. The key epidemiological link was the exposure to tsetse fly bites in a game park two weeks prior. The infection was determined to be first-stage as the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.",
