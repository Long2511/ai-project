  "patient_information": "A 28-year-old Malawian man who works as a fisherman. He was diagnosed with arterial hypertension two years prior and prescribed antihypertensive drugs, which he never took. His medical and family history are otherwise unremarkable, and a recent HIV test was negative.",
  "chief_complaint": "Progressive shortness of breath over the past 5 days.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 5-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also developed continuous, dull bilateral flank pain and constant nausea over the past few days. He reported no cough and no fever.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is a fisherman from a town on the southern shore of Lake Malawi. This occupation involves regular contact with water known to be infested with Schistosoma haematobium.",
  "vitals": "On admission, his blood pressure was 200/130 mmHg, pulse was 66 bpm, temperature was 36.8°C, and respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was in respiratory distress with notably pale conjunctivae. His apex beat was slightly displaced, and heart sounds were clear and regular. There were bilateral fine crackles over the lung bases. The abdomen was non-tender, but there was bilateral renal angle tenderness with ballottable kidneys. No peripheral oedema was noted.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Admission labs showed a white blood cell count of 3.8×10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 6.0 mg/dL, and platelets of 187×10⁹/L. Renal function was severely impaired with a creatinine of 1200 µmol/L, BUN of 89.3 mmol/L, and severe hyperkalaemia (K+ 7.2 mmol/L). An ultrasound revealed bilateral hydronephrosis with massive dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces, with very thin remaining renal parenchyma. Cystoscopy showed a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple 'sandy patches' suggestive of granulomatous lesions. A chest radiograph on admission showed signs of pulmonary congestion.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The initial clinical impression was combined left-sided cardiac failure and renal failure, likely secondary to malignant hypertension. The enlarged kidneys raised the possibility of a primary renal condition like polycystic kidneys or a post-renal obstruction. Due to the patient's occupation and regular contact with infested water in Lake Malawi, chronic schistosomiasis causing hydronephrosis was a top differential diagnosis.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was treated with high doses of furosemide without improvement in urine output, and glucose and insulin for hyperkalaemia. He deteriorated, becoming drowsy with a new pericardial friction rub suggestive of uraemia. A bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, and peritoneal dialysis was initiated, leading to rapid improvement. He was discharged home on peritoneal dialysis. Two months later, he was readmitted with fever and abdominal pain, treated for suspected bacterial peritonitis, and died three weeks into his hospital stay.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is end-stage renal disease due to chronic urogenital schistosomiasis. This was caused by obstructive uropathy resulting from infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was supported by the patient's occupational exposure as a fisherman in Lake Malawi, severe renal failure with malignant hypertension, ultrasound findings of bilateral hydronephrosis, and pathognomonic 'sandy patches' seen on cystoscopy, which indicate granulomatous inflammation from trapped schistosome eggs.",
