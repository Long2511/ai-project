  "patient_information": "A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi with no history of trauma or past tuberculosis. His HIV status was initially unknown but he was later found to be HIV-positive. He is a non-smoker but drinks about one litre of a locally brewed beer daily. He is married with three children who are all well.",
  "chief_complaint": "Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.",
  "vitals": "On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.",
  "physical_exam": "Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.",
  "disease_name_short": "Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)"
