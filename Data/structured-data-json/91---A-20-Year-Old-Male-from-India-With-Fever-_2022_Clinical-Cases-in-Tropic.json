  "patient_information": "A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India. He had a history of a dog bite one month prior to symptom onset, for which he received five doses of purified chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).",
  "chief_complaint": "Admission to hospital for fever and quadriparesis.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient experienced fever for four days, which was followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg. The weakness subsequently progressed to involve all four limbs over the next two days, resulting in a rapidly progressive quadriparesis.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient, from southern India (a rabies-endemic country), reported a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb one month before his symptoms began. He received a full course of five anti-rabies vaccine doses but did not receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as part of his post-exposure prophylaxis.",
  "vitals": "On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).",
  "physical_exam": "On admission, the patient was conscious with normal mental functions (GCS 15/15). The neurological examination revealed a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Blood investigations, including serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a protein level of 52 mg/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and a pleocytosis of 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes). A saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR, while a CSF sample was negative for the virus.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "A high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies was maintained due to the dog bite history and presentation. Clinical mimics considered included Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and post-vaccination encephalomyelitis. However, features such as fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, and significant CSF pleocytosis helped differentiate this case from GBS.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "After admission, the patient's condition worsened, developing autonomic instability with increased perspiration and variable heart rate and blood pressure. He progressed to dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day of hospitalization. His management was supportive. The patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days after the onset of his symptoms.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is paralytic rabies. This is based on the classic history of a WHO category III dog bite one month prior in a rabies-endemic area, followed by a clinical presentation of fever and rapidly progressive, ascending flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR in a saliva sample. The failure to administer rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) after the severe exposure was a critical lapse in post-exposure prophylaxis, which likely led to the development of the fatal disease despite vaccination.",
