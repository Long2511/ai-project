  "patient_information": "A 4-year-old girl from Uganda, described as previously healthy, with no report of recent head trauma or other known reasons for illness.",
  "chief_complaint": "Unconsciousness following a seizure.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was well until the day prior to presentation, when she developed a bad headache in the afternoon, followed by shaking chills in the evening. She slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. on the day of presentation, she was found having a seizure that lasted about ten minutes. She did not awaken afterwards, and it took her family four hours to bring her to the Accident and Emergency Department.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient lives in rural eastern Uganda during the rainy season. Malaria is a common problem in her village, and the family initially suspected her illness was another episode of malaria, indicating residence in a high-transmission area.",
  "vitals": "On admission, her temperature was 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse was 150 bpm, respiratory rate was 36 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 98/40 mmHg. A rapid test for glucose was normal.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient was deeply comatose with a Blantyre Coma Scale of 1/5. She had nasal flaring, a gallop rhythm on cardiac exam, and hepatosplenomegaly, with the liver palpable 2 cm and the spleen 4 cm below the costal margins. Neurologically, she had no neck stiffness, pupils were 2 mm and reactive, and extraocular movements were normal by oculocephalic manoeuvres. With stimulation, she exhibited decerebrate posturing that resolved spontaneously. Initial direct ophthalmoscopy showed no papilloedema, but a later examination after mydriatic drops revealed white-centred haemorrhages in both eyes.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results on admission revealed a haematocrit of 17.6% (indicating anaemia) and a platelet count of 28 x 10^9/L (thrombocytopenia). The Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) was positive. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and acellular with a normal opening pressure. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Blood cultures were taken.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The differential diagnosis for coma included cerebral malaria, acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, and intoxication. Metabolic abnormalities like hypoglycaemia and non-convulsive status epilepticus were also considered. Hypoglycaemia was ruled out by a normal rapid glucose test, and a post-ictal state was considered unlikely as four hours had passed since the seizure. Although neck stiffness was absent, this was considered an unreliable sign in deep coma, so meningitis could not be initially excluded. The positive malaria RDT was noted as potentially non-specific due to high rates of asymptomatic parasitaemia in the region.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was started on intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg, which was repeated at 12 and 24 hours, and then continued once daily. She was admitted to a high-dependency unit for monitoring. Twelve hours after admission, she experienced a single, brief, self-resolving generalized seizure. Her level of consciousness improved, with her Blantyre Coma Score rising to 4/5 by 40 hours after admission. She was discharged home on hospital day five with a scheduled neurology follow-up.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis was retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria. This diagnosis was made based on the presence of an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with a positive malaria RDT, consistent with the WHO definition. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the ophthalmoscopic finding of white-centred haemorrhages, a key feature of malarial retinopathy, which is highly specific for cerebral malaria and helps distinguish it from coma with incidental parasitaemia. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial meningitis were excluded by the normal CSF findings.",
