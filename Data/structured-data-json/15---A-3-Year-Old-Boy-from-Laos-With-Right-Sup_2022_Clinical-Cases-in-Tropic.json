  "patient_information": "A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.",
  "chief_complaint": "A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.",
  "vitals": "On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).",
  "physical_exam": "The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.",
