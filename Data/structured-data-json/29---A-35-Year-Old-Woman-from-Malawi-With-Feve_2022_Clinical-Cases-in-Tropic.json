  "patient_information": "A 35-year-old Malawian woman, divorced with three children aged 17, 15, and 12. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables. The patient was newly diagnosed with HIV and noted to be wasted with a BMI of 17 kg/m². She had a history of progressive weakness for several months despite taking iron tablets prescribed two months prior.",
  "chief_complaint": "Fever and weakness, with fever starting 3 days prior to presentation.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 3-day history of fever, superimposed on progressive weakness that had worsened over several months. She reported some weight loss but denied cough, night sweats, diarrhea, dysuria, or any abnormal bleeding. Two months earlier, she had sought care for weakness, was noted to be clinically pale, and was prescribed iron tablets, but her weakness continued to progress.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "The patient is from Malawi, a high-prevalence setting for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables. She is divorced, and her three children are well. Her children and past/current sexual partners were later encouraged to be tested for HIV.",
  "vitals": "On admission, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm, temperature was 37.8°C (100°F), respiratory rate was 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air. Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15.",
  "physical_exam": "The patient appeared wasted (BMI 17 kg/m²) with very pale conjunctivae and no jaundice. Examination of her mouth was normal, with no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, or oral hairy leukoplakia. Her chest was clear. The abdomen was soft with slight diffuse tenderness and no guarding. The spleen was palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. The rectal examination was normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial investigations showed a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test and a positive HIV serology. The full blood count revealed leukopenia (WBC 3.0 x 10^9/L), severe anaemia (Haemoglobin 4.8 mg/dL), a normal MCV (90 fL), and borderline low platelets (112 x 10^9/L). Subsequent blood cultures grew Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium. Tuberculosis screening revealed prominent hilar lymph nodes.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "The primary suspected diagnosis was invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection, given the septic presentation without a clear focus in a newly diagnosed, wasted, and anemic HIV-positive patient. Other considerations included enteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid), which are clinically indistinguishable but less common. Tuberculosis was also a strong possibility, particularly as a cause for severe anaemia. Visceral leishmaniasis was considered but thought unlikely as it is not endemic in Malawi and the patient lacked gross hepatosplenomegaly.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient was initiated on IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily and fluid resuscitation after blood cultures were drawn. Upon culture results, her antibiotics were changed to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg three times daily for 14 days. She was also commenced on antituberculous treatment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, vitamin B6, and therapeutic feeding. She was discharged after 4 weeks and at a 3-month follow-up was feeling better, had gained weight, and her hemoglobin levels were improving.",
  "final_diagnosis": "The patient was diagnosed with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection, with the causative agent identified as Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium by blood culture. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of sepsis with fever, severe anaemia, and splenomegaly in the context of newly diagnosed, advanced HIV infection. Concomitant tuberculosis was also suspected due to radiologic findings and the high-risk setting, and treatment was initiated accordingly.",
