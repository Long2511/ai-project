  "chief_complaint": "Acute high fever with rash for approximately one week.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Abrupt febrile illness reaching 39.5 °C with severe myalgias and retro-orbital pain, followed by a maculopapular rash. Symptoms began shortly after travel and evolved over 7 days.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Recent travel to rural Thailand one week prior; mosquito exposure is implied by the endemic setting. No animal or water/food exposures or sick contacts were reported.",

    "Dengue NS1 antigen test": "Positive on day 2",

  "differential_diagnosis": "Considered dengue fever versus chikungunya and malaria. Dengue supported by NS1 positivity, thrombocytopenia, and travel to an endemic area. Malaria less likely given dengue confirmation and no malaria-specific findings reported.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Supportive care with oral/IV fluids and acetaminophen; no antibiotics. Clinical improvement with full recovery by day 6; no complications documented.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Dengue fever due to dengue virus, confirmed by a positive NS1 antigen test. The diagnosis aligns with acute febrile illness, thrombocytopenia, retro-orbital pain, and compatible travel exposure. Malaria and chikungunya were considered less likely given confirmatory testing and symptom pattern.",
