  "chief_complaint": "Problem: difficulty in walking Duration: acute onset, less than 1 week",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Timeline: illness started about 2 years earlier with an acute onset and no progression over 2 years Key symptoms: legs began to feel heavy and started to tremble, causing difficulty in walking Pertinent negatives: no history of fever, pain, sensory, bladder or bowel symptoms or disease progression Severity pattern: non-progressive",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Residence travel: lives in a village in northern Tanzania with limited agricultural suitability where the main staple food crop is cassava Vectors animals: no history of back pain, no sensory impairment and no bladder dysfunction Water food risks: diet for 2 months before illness was almost exclusively cassava Contacts season outbreak context: illness started about 2 years earlier with an acute onset. Several other people are also affected in his own and neighboring villages at around the same time. Occupation: works as a shoe repairer",

  "physical_exam": "General nourishment: well nourished with normal vital signs Cranial nerves: normal but bilateral optic pallor noted on fundoscopy Limbs: symmetrical spastic paraparesis with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees, hyperreflexia, sustained ankle clonus, extensor plantar responses Arms: normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia",

  "management_and_clinical_course": "Supportive care: management is therefore directed at support, symptomatic improvement and disease prevention. Symptomatic improvement: the majority of patients can walk with the aid of a stick or crutches and some will benefit from a wheelchair Disease prevention: there is no cure for patients with konzo because it results in a permanent spastic paraparesis",
  "final_diagnosis": "Clinical syndrome: spastic paraparesis Likely cause: chronic high dietary exposure of cyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava tubers, but the exact pathogenic mechanism of konzo remain unknown. Confirmation method: symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or genitourinary involvement Evidence: [\"acute onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive course\", \"occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other cases emerging at the same time\"]",
