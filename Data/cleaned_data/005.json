  "patient_information": "Age: 4 years old Sex: male Country of origin: Laos Comorbidities: chronically malnourished, living in a remote village of a poor developing country Immunization status: unimmunized",
  "chief_complaint": "Description: a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face Duration: three days ago",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Timeline: Three days ago, family noticed a dark sore on the child’s cheek. Key symptoms: The lesion progressed quickly from a sore to eat through the child’s cheek. The child has a fever and rash about 2 months ago and recovered. Severity pattern: The lesion is rapidly destructive.",

  "physical_exam": "Description: a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face, mouth has a gangrenous lesion that has destroyed part of his upper and lower lips and cheek, exposing his teeth. Systemic examination: no specific systemic examination details provided",

  "differential_diagnosis": "Considered diseases: [\"noma (an opportunistic infection affecting poor children)\", \"other ulcerating facial lesions such as oral cancer, syphilis and yaws are unlikely in a young child\", \"cutaneous leishmaniasis is unlikely to develop at such a rapid pace and be so destructive\"] Justification: [\"The rapid destruction of tissue is typical of noma.\", \"Other ulcerating facial lesions are less likely given the age of the patient.\"]",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Treatment plan: treating the child with penicillin and metronidazole to cover the suspected aerobic and anaerobic oropharyngeal bacteria. Supportive care: emphasizing the need for nutritional support, which can be challenging with a mouth lesion. Procedures: necrotic tissue can be removed. Physiotherapy will be needed to prevent contractures with healing. Response complications outcome: the child was treated successfully with antibiotics and nutritional support. His face healed with contractures resulting in disfigurement and salivary incontinence.",
  "final_diagnosis": "{'disease_name_short': 'Noma', 'causative_agent_confirmation_method': \"treatment with antibiotics and nutritional support can prevent disease progression and save the child's life.\", 'evidence_alternatives_ruled_out': 'The true etiology of noma is unknown. The pathogenesis appears to be a complex combination of factors, such as poverty, poor oral hygiene facilitating necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, malnutrition and infectious diseases such as malaria and measles leading to impaired immunity.'}",
