On examina-\ntion there is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and a\nthoracic sensory level. He denies any constitutional symp-\ntoms. His past medical history is unremarkable. His HIV sta-\ntus is unknown.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Neuroanatomical Syndrome and What\nis Your Differential Diagnosis?\n\nThe clinical signs — spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia,\nupgoing plantar reflexes and thoracic sensory level — localize\nthe lesion to the spinal cord. The bladder is usually involved\nin spinal cord disease, but the absence of bladder symptoms\ndoes not rule out spinal cord involvement, particularly in\nslowly progressive lesions, as in our case.\n\nSpinal cord disease can be traumatic or non-traumatic.\nNothing in the patient’s history suggests trauma. Non-\ntraumatic spinal cord disease can be compressive or\nnon-compressive. Compressive disease is sometimes amena-\nble to spinal surgery.\n\nCommon causes of adult non-traumatic compressive spi-\nnal cord disease in sub-Saharan Africa are spinal TB (‘Pott’s\ndisease’), spinal metastases and degenerative spinal disease\nincluding slipped disc. Common causes of non-compressive\nspinal cord disease are schistosomiasis, autoimmune trans-\nverse myelitis and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWhat is the Further Management?\n\nThe diagnosis of spinal cord disease in resource-limited set-\ntings is often clinical (Table 11.1). Management should\nfocus on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying aetiology\nand on prevention and treatment of the complications of spi-\nnal cord disease. Diagnostic clues and possible treatment reg-\nimens are summarized in Table 11.2.\n\nAll patients should be tested for HIV, ova of Schistosoma\nspp. in urine and stool and evidence of TB or neoplasia on\nchest- and spinal radiography. If available, ultrasound exam-\nination of the abdomen is very valuable in tumour-screening\nand TB work-up.

He comes from a village\nin the North of Togo, located close to a rapidly flowing river.\nMany adults in the village are blind.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is Your Most Important Differential\nDiagnosis?\n\nThe clinical triad of ocular changes, itchy dermatitis with\natrophy of the skin and subcutaneous nodules in a patient\nfrom rural Togo makes onchocerciasis (river blindness) the\nmost likely differential diagnosis. A fast-flowing river is the\npreferred breeding site for Simulium blackflies, which trans-\nmit the disease.\n\nThe picture of his left eye shows keratitis semilunaris, a\nform of band-shaped sclerosing keratopathy commonly seen\nin onchocerciasis. The central and upper parts of the cornea\nare initially clear, but may become affected as the disease\nprogresses.\n\nSubcutaneous nodules can resemble lipomas and cysti-\ncerci of Taenia solium.\n\nPruritic dermatitis may also be caused by scabies or be\nseen in papular pruritic eruptions associated with HIV\ninfection. In patients from West Africa, infection with\nMansonella streptocerca can also cause pruritus. Chronic\ndermatitis can also be seen in yaws, leprosy, mycotic infec-\ntions and eczema.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWhat Investigations Would You Like to Carry Out?\n\nThe patient’s presentation appears very typical for onchocer-\nciasis. In an endemic, resource-limited setting his diagnosis\nwould most probably be made on clinical grounds alone.\nSkin snips taken from the vicinity of a subcutaneous nodule\nmay show microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus.\n\nSlit-lamp examination of the eyes may reveal microfilariae\nin the anterior chamber of the eye and in the cornea. Nodu-\nlectomy of subcutaneous nodules may show adults of O. vol-\nvulus, but this is not routinely done.\n\nSerological tests were less useful in patients from endemic\nareas in the past, because antibody test results lacked speci-\nficity and were not clearly linked to clinical disease.\n\nHowever, serological tests which detect IgG4 responses to\nO. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and the recombinant Ov16 anti-\ngen are recommended by WHO. In case of a positive result it\nis recommended to continue ivermectin therapy.\n\nThe lifespan of the adult worms is about 12 years. After\n10 years, usually no further treatment with ivermectin is\nrequired after therapy with a combination of ivermectin\nand doxycycline, if ivermectin was administered 2 to 3\ntimes every year and if serological tests have turned nega-\ntive. However, in onchocerciasis-endemic areas new infec-\ntions are possible. To calculate the probability of a\nreinfection through an individual black fly with O. volvulus,\n\nworm-specific DNA (Ov150) is tested by poolscreen in vec-\ntor samples (black flies) using polymerase chain reaction.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was treated with ivermectin (150 jig/kg) STAT\nwhich was repeated after 3 months and after 1 year. He also\nreceived doxycycline 100 mg/d for 6 weeks (see Summary\nBox).\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nOnchocerciasis\n\nOnchocerciasis (‘river blindness’) is caused by O. volvulus, a\n\nfilarial nematode. It is transmitted by biting Simulium species\n\nblackflies, which breed in rapidly flowing freshwater. Adult\n\nfemales of O. volvulus lodge in human subcutaneous tissue and\n\nshed live microfilariae. Microfilariae migrate through the skin and\n\noften into the eyes. Most pathology is caused by immune reac-\n\ntions to dead and dying microfilariae and perhaps to their endo-\n\nsymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. Typical clinical features of\n\nonchocerciasis are:\n\n1. Non-tender subcutaneous nodules located mainly over bony\nprominences\n\n2. Dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin (‘leopard skin’),\nlichenification and thickening of the skin (‘lizard skin’), and\nskin atrophy at times leading to ‘hanging groins’. The skin\nchanges may be stigmatizing and the unrelenting itch may\ncause sleep disturbances, depression and even lead to\nsuicide\n\n3. Ocular changes may present as pear-shaped pupil, punc-\ntate subepithelial stromal keratopathy, sclerosing keratitis,\niritis, uveitis, ‘flecked retina’ or scarred choroidoretinal fun-\ndus (Hissette-Ridley fundus). Optic nerve atrophy\n\nmay occur.\n\nIvermectin is now the drug of choice for individual and mass\ntreatment of onchocerciasis. Ivermectin kills microfilariae but has\nlittle effect on adult worms apart from reducing embryogenesis. It\nhas to be given repeatedly throughout the lifespan of the adult\nworm (10-14 years). For individual treatment, ivermectin is pro-\nvided as a single dose of 150 j1g/kg PO. Treatment should be\nrepeated in 3- to 6-month intervals. In mass treatment pro-\ngrammes it is usually provided annually. Ivermectin should not be\ngiven to patients with heavy Loa loa infections and microfilarial\ncounts greater than 30,000/mL, because this may result in fatal\nencephalitis. lvermectin can also cause significant adverse events\nin patients with lower microfilarial counts. For regions co-endemic\nof onchocerciasis and L. loa, a mobile phone-based, point-of-\ncare microscopy tool — the LoaScope — has proven helpful to\neasily identify patients with high parasitaemia of L. loa and to\nexempt them from mass treatment with ivermectin. This tech-\nnology has increased the acceptance of ivermectin MDA for\nonchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in L. loa co-endemic areas.\n\nIvermectin is contraindicated in pregnancy and in children\nbelow the age of five or below a height of 90cm.\n\nDoxycycline at a dosage of 100 to 200 mg/d for 4 to 6 weeks\nkills the Wolbachia endosymbionts, permanently sterilizes adult\nworms, blocks embryogenesis and slowly kills approximately\n60% of adult worms.\n\nA major breakthrough in the battle against onchocerciasis was\nthe ivermectin-donation programme initiated by the producing\ncompany Merck. Large control programmes implementing mass\ndrug administration (MDA) of ivermectin in endemic areas in Africa\nand South America lead to interruption of transmission of\nonchocerciasis in many countries.\n\nElimination of the disease is still on the agenda.", "summary": null}}

Chest radi-\nography and CT show small, nodular changes in the periphery\nof both lungs.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses and Which\nInvestigations Would You Like to Do?\n\nThe patient has travelled in Mozambique without taking any\nantimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Thus first of all malaria has\nto be excluded — irrespective of any other symptoms or lab-\noratory results.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of pyrexia in a returned traveller\nis long, but typhoid fever and amoebic liver abscess should\nalways be excluded because they are common and potentially\nlife-threatening diseases. Therefore blood cultures should be\ntaken and an abdominal ultrasound should be done. In con-\ntrast to what was seen in this patient though, typhoid fever\nusually causes eosinopaenia.\n\nThe further differential diagnosis of fever after a stay in\ntropical areas relies on the precise itinerary, the activities\nindulged in during travel, the presence of focal symptoms,\nsigns and laboratory results.\n\nThe patient has slightly elevated liver enzymes. The dif-\nferential diagnosis of acute infections involving the liver\nincludes viral hepatitis, including hepatitis E.\n\nEBV and CMV infections may also cause fever, elevated\nliver enzymes and a rise in LDH. They are important differ-\nentials of fever in returned travellers. However, EBV and\nCMV cause lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, rather\nthan eosinophilia. Splenomegaly is usually part of the clinical\npicture of mononucleosis and lymphadenopathy, even though\nthe latter can be less prominent in acute CMV infection.\n\nLeptospirosis, rickettsioses and Q-fever are bacterial infec-\ntions to consider, as well as brucellosis, secondary syphilis\nand relapsing fever. Yet none of these infections as such\nwould explain the patient’s pronounced eosinophilia.\n\n \n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat is the Significance of Eosinophilia in\nReturning Travellers?\n\nIn any patient returning from the tropics with eosinophilia, a\nhelminth infection should be ruled out. The most relevant\ndifferential diagnosis in this patient who presents with eosin-\nophilia and fever reporting freshwater contact is acute schis-\ntosomiasis, also known as Katayama syndrome. Another rare\ncause of fever, eosinophilia and elevated liver transaminases is\nacute fascioliasis.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThick films for Plasmodium species were negative.

The fact\nthat the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a\n\n \n\n58\n\n \n\nreason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in\nmalaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at\npresentation. A common misdiagnosis is acute viral hepatitis;\nthere, fever precedes the jaundice, and this rapid fulminant\ncourse would not be typical. Other causes of acute fever and\njaundice include typhoid fever, leptospirosis and ascending\ncholangitis.

There\nis no history of back pain. On examination, there is no sen-\nsory impairment and no bladder dysfunction. The main sta-\nple food crop in his village is cassava.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat is the Clinical Diagnosis?\n\nThe clinical syndrome is spastic paraparesis. The main differen-\ntial diagnosis in Africa includes spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s dis-\nease), transverse myelitis, spinal cord infections such as\nschistosomiasis and tuberculous myelitis, spinal malignancy\n(mainly metastases) and tropical nutritional myeloneuropathies.\n\nThere are three important features in our case: (1) the\nisolated involvement of motor neurons without any sensory\nand bladder involvement; (2) the absence of back pain; and\n(3) the acute onset with no progression over 2 years. These\nthree clinical points make spinal tuberculosis, spinal cord\ninfection or spinal malignancy very unlikely. Of note, his\ndiet (and probably that of his siblings and other children\nin the village) for the 2 months before the illness was almost\nexclusively cassava, and the same disease has affected one of\nhis siblings and more children in the neighborhood. Hence, a\nnutritional cause must be suspected.\n\nThe tropical myeloneuropathies that are nutritional in\norigin are konzo and lathyrism. Lathyrism in Africa occurs\nexclusively in Ethiopia. The clinical diagnosis in our patient\nis konzo. Konzo is a distinct form of tropical spastic parapar-\nesis which occurs exclusively in cassava-growing areas in\n\nAfrica.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Do You Plan to Manage this Patient?\n\nThere is no cure for patients with konzo because it results in a\npermanent spastic paraparesis. Management is therefore\ndirected at support, symptomatic improvement and disease\nprevention. The majority of patients can walk with the aid\nof a stick or crutches and some will benefit from a wheelchair.\nMuscle relaxants have a limited role because of relative inef-\nfectiveness as a result of the severity of the spasticity, and\n\nthese agents’ high long-term cost. Surgical treatment involv-\ning Achilles tendon lengthening operations have proved use-\nful in improving mobilization in selected patients with\nkonzo. Because of the severity of contractures in this patient,\nhe should be assessed for surgery.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nAt follow-up examination at 6 and 12 months, the findings\nwere unchanged, with a permanent spastic paraparesis. The\npatient had not been referred for surgery because of the lack\nof resources and the extent of the epidemic, with many other\nsimilar cases in the community. He uses one stick with very\nrestricted mobility and works as a shoe repairer in his village.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nKonzo\n\nKonzo is a distinct form of tropical spastic paraparesis, which\noccurs exclusively in cassava-growing areas in Africa. The word\n“konzo” means “tied legs” in the language of the Yaka tribe in the\nDRC. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of a permanent but\nnon-progressive form of spastic paraparesis related to cassava\nconsumption. It occurs mainly as epidemics, typically during\ndroughts, famines or armed conflict when there is an overreliance\non cassava as a staple food for weeks or months. It also occurs in\nan endemic form but at much lower rates. It affects mainly children\nand breastfeeding mothers.\nThe following are the clinical criteria for diagnosing konzo:\n¢ symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or geni-\ntourinary involvement\n¢ abrupt onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive\ncourse\n\n¢ occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other\ncases emerging at the same time\n\n¢ no other cause found\n\nIts cause is attributed to chronic high dietary exposure of\ncyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava\ntubers, but the exact pathogenic mechanisms of konzo remain\nunknown.\n\nCassava is a staple food for more than 600 million people. It\ngrows well in poor soils and is resistant to drought, plant diseases,\ninsects and animal predators, but it contains cyanogenic glyco-\nsides, mainly linamarin. Processing disrupts the tubers releasing\ncyanide, which makes the food safe for human consumption.\nKonzo is associated with high intake of insufficiently processed\ncassava tubers in combination with low or absent levels of the\nessential amino acids methionine or cysteine. Oxidative stress\nand glutamate-mediated neuro-excitatory cell death appears\nlikely to be the final pathogenic mechanism. This results in a\nClinically exclusive pattern of upper motor neurone disease.", "summary": null}}

It also presents with fever, severe myal-\ngias, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhages. Acute kidney\ninjury and jaundice are uncommon for DHF.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Tests Are Indicated to Confirm the\nDiagnosis?\n\nThe microscopic diagnosis of leptospirosis requires a dark-\nfield or a phase-contrast microscope because the bacteria\nstain poorly. However, dark-field microscopy is of poor sen-\nsitivity and specificity and only yields positive results during\nthe early bacteraemic phase of the disease.\n\nLeptospira may be cultured from blood, CSF or urine. Iso-\nlation of the bacteria from blood or CSF is only possible dur-\ning the first week of illness. Samples have to be incubated for\nat least 8 weeks and analysed weekly with a dark-field micro-\nscope. This technique is laborious and not routine practice in\na standard microbiological laboratory.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection has been used\non blood, CSF and urine. PCR performance varies between\ntypes of samples taken and depends on the time the sample\nwas taken in relation to duration of illness. Sensitivity and\nspecificity appear to be higher in urine than in blood and\nare better in blood samples taken early rather than later dur-\ning the course of illness.\n\nFor indirect diagnosis, the historical reference serological\ntest is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). MAT relies\non incubation of patient serum with Leptospira antigen sus-\npension and determines agglutination with a dark-field\nmicroscope. This method requires a high level of expertise\nand is limited to expert centres.\n\nThe MAT cannot differentiate between current or past\ninfections. Therefore two consecutive serum samples should\nbe examined to look for seroconversion or at least a fourfold\nrise in titre. The significance of titres in single serum speci-\nmens is a matter of debate.\n\nVarious ELISA tests detecting anti-Leptospira IgM are\nnow commercially available, facilitating the diagnosis outside\nreference centres. It appears that sensitivity of these tests is\nhighly variable if blood is examined during week one of\nthe illness, it improves (75% and 100%) if blood is taken\nafter day 7. A positive IgM ELISA should be confirmed\nby MAT.\n\n \n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nSevere leptospirosis was suspected and the patient was com-\nmenced on empirical benzylpenicillin. Despite rehydration\nhe developed acute renal failure warranting haemodialysis\n(HD). He developed myocarditis and atrial fibrillation,\nbut luckily tolerated further HD. He gradually recovered\nover 10 days with intensive care management.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nLeptospirosis\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs worldwide. It is\ncaused by pathogenic Leptospira species, which belong to the\nspirochaetes. The most common species causing disease in\nhumans and animals are L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii.\n\nHumans become infected through direct contact with urine of\ninfected mammalian hosts, contact with contaminated water or\nanimal abortion products. The major reservoirs are rodents,\ncanines, livestock and wild mammals. Most at risk are slum\ndwellers and people with an occupational or recreational\nexposure involving animal contact or immersion in water. Also,\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes and floods may put people\nat risk.\n\nThe bacteria enter the human body through cuts or abrasions\nof the skin or through intact mucous membranes. The incubation\nperiod is 2 to 30 days. The spectrum of disease ranges from\nasymptomatic to severe infection.\n\nThe classical presentation of leptospirosis is that of a biphasic\nillness. The initial leptospiraemic phase usually starts abruptly.\nSymptoms are non-specific with fever, headache, sore throat,\nabdominal pain and a rash. Severe myalgias, most notably of the\ncalves and the lumbar area, and subconjunctival haemorrhage\nhave been mentioned as distinguishing physical findings. This first\nphase lasts for a week and is followed by a second phase\ndominated by immune-mediated pathology.\n\nFive to ten per cent of those with clinical infection will develop\nsevere leptospirosis with cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury\nand haemorrhagic diathesis (Weil’s syndrome). Further compli-\ncations include pulmonary involvement, aseptic meningitis and\nmyocarditis.", "summary": null}}

This boy has all five criteria:\n\n1. Follicles on the tarsal (inner) conjunctiva. These are 0.5\nto 2 mm pale, raised inflammatory foci with hyperaemic\nsurround.

He was referred to the ophthalmol-\nogist for lid surgery to redress trichiasis, and for a conjunc-\ntival flap to seal the corneal defect.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nTrachoma\n\nTrachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading\ninfectious cause of blindness in the world. It accounts for\n\nabout 1.4% of the world’s blindness, but rates in affected\ncommunities in Africa are much higher. In endemic areas, active\ntrachoma prevalence in pre-school children can be as high as\n60% to 90%.\n\nTrachoma is common in poor rural communities, where there\nis scarcity of water, poor sanitation and low socioeconomic sta-\ntus. The spread occurs because of overcrowding within house-\nholds. Women are affected more than men and younger children\nare at greater risk of infection, especially children under\n5 years old.\n\nAfter repeated infections in childhood, signs of trachoma\nprogress from conjunctival inflammation to scarring. Scarring of\nthe tarsal conjunctiva leads to inversion of the lid resulting in tri-\nchiasis. Repetitive damage and infections lead to corneal scarring\nand consequent visual impairment or blindness.\n\nA simplified scheme for assessing and classifying trachoma\nbased on clinical signs has been developed. The stages are:\n\nTrachomatous inflammation with follicles (TF)\n\nIntense trachomatous inflammation (Tl)\n\nTrachomatous conjunctival scarring (TS)\n\nTrachomatous trichiasis (TT) and\n\nCorneal opacity because of trachoma (CO).\n\nTF and TI are prevalent in young children and are manifesta-\ntions of moderate and severe active infection, while TT is common\nin adults.\n\nWHO has a global programme to eliminate trachoma as a\ndisease of public health importance by 2020 (GET 2020).

A throat\nswab, or sputum sample if there is pulmonary involvement,\nmay also be cultured on selective media, such as Ashdown’s\nagar. A chest radiograph (CXR) should be done looking for\nevidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. An ultrasound of\nthe abdomen, or other imaging such as CT or MRI scan,\nshould also be considered, because the findings of liver\nand splenic abscesses would strongly support a diagnosis of\nmelioidosis while culture results are awaited. Biochemistry\nassays to check glucose and creatinine are important to opti-\nmize glycaemic control and adjust drug dosage respectively.\nDepending on the CXR findings, sputum, pleural fluid\nand pus may be sent for staining for acid-fast bacilli (e.g.\nZiehl—Neelsen stain) and M. tuberculosis-PCR (e.g. Xpert\nMTB/RIF).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nPus culture yielded B. pseudomallei after 48 hours, and later\nhis blood culture also grew the same bacterium. Three throat\nswabs were cultured on selective media but failed to grow the\norganism. The CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions\n(Fig. 32.2). A shoulder radiograph showed no evidence of\nbony involvement. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatos-\nplenomegaly without evidence of liver or splenic abscesses.\n\n \n\n¢ Fig. 32.2 Admission chest radiograph of the patient, showing bilateral\npleural effusions.\n\nThe patient was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and\ngentamicin while awaiting the culture results. Treatment was\nswitched to ceftazidime after 48 hours when the laboratory\nalerted the clinicians to the suspicion of melioidosis. The\npatient improved after 7 days of treatment and was afebrile\nby day 14, when he was switched to oral co-trimoxazole to\ncomplete 20 weeks. Glycaemic control was established.\nNo other foci of infection were detected by locally available\ninvestigations. The patient was discharged after 21 days of\nhospitalization and continued on oral ‘eradication’ treatment\nfor 5 months. He remains well.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nMelioidosis\n\nMelioidosis is an infectious disease caused by B. pseudomallei,\nan environmental saprophyte endemic to South and South-east\nAsia and northern Australia. The disease is being described with\nincreasing frequency both in non-endemic and in endemic areas.\nThis may be because of a combination of greater awareness,\nimproving laboratory facilities and research and possibly also as a\nresult of a genuine increase in incidence. A modelling study has\nestimated 165,000 human melioidosis cases with 89,000 deaths\nper year worldwide making it a significant neglected tropical\ndisease (NTD), even though it does not feature on the WHO’s list\nof NTDs.\n\nNorth-eastern Thailand and northern Australia are highly\nendemic areas, where B. pseudomallei is an important cause of\ncommunity-acquired sepsis and pneumonia. It is probably widely\ndistributed elsewhere outside the endemic region and may be\ngreatly underdiagnosed.\n\nHumans are thought usually to become infected by percuta-\nneous inoculation through cuts and abrasions (e.g. when working\nin rice fields), inhalation/aspiration during severe weather events\nand ingestion (e.g. ingestion of contaminated and unchlorinated\nwater supplies), although it is often difficult to determine precisely\nthe mode of acquisition. Host factors are very important; the\nmajority of cases occur in those who are immunocompromised,\nespecially with diabetes mellitus, but also alcoholism, chronic lung", "summary": null}}

Chest radiography shows a prominent hilar region\nbut is otherwise normal.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat is Your Suspected Diagnosis?\n\nIn all HIV-positive patients with cough and weight loss who\ndo not respond to antibiotic therapy, tuberculosis is top of\nthe list of differential diagnoses. In this case the most likely\ndiagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary TB.\n\nTB in patients with advanced immunosuppression often\npresents with a clinical picture that is very different from\nimmunocompetent individuals: sputum smear-negative\nTB, which is uncommon in HIV-negative patients, is com-\nmonly seen in HIV-infected patients, particularly if immu-\nnosuppression is advanced as in this case. The slightly\nprominent hilar region seen on the patient's chest radiograph\nis compatible with the intrathoracic lymphadenopathy: typ-\nical though not specific for TB. Physical examination of the\nchest is normal in about half of HIV patients with\npulmonary TB.\n\nThe fact that the patient does not report any TB contact\nshould not be overvalued. Firstly, TB in immunosuppression\nis often a consequence of reactivation and the primary infec-\ntion may have been decades ago. Secondly, in resource-limited\ncountries, practically everyone is exposed to TB — this could\noccur during a ride on an overcrowded minibus or when con-\ngregating with friends and family in someone’s small home.\n\nGiven the fact that our patient is in an advanced stage of\nimmunosuppression and has not taken any co-trimoxazole\nprophylaxis, an alternative or possibly co-existing diagnosis\nto consider is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A\nconcomitant bacterial chest infection is possible but unlikely\nto explain the whole 3 months of illness.\n\nKaposi’s sarcoma (KS) of the lung is another differential\ndiagnosis to consider, but patients with pulmonary KS usu-\nally have manifestations of KS elsewhere (skin, oral mucosa).\nOn chest radiography of patients with pulmonary KS, patchy\ninfiltrations are commonly seen in the lower lung zones. Nei-\nther was the case in our patient, which makes this diagnosis\nunlikely.\n\nPulmonary malignancy or pulmonary sarcoidosis, which\nwould be high on the list of differential diagnoses in indus-\ntrialized countries, are much less likely than an infectious\ncause in the given setting.\n\nApart from chest infections, Gram-negative sepsis second-\nary to invasive non-typhoidal Sa/monellae (iNTS) needs to be\nconsidered in this febrile and anaemic patient with advanced\nimmunosuppression.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Approach This Patient?\n\nInduced sputum should be examined for acid-fast bacilli.\nReal-time PCR-based tests such as XPert MTB/RIF are\neasy to use, more sensitive than microscopy and also help\ndetect rifampicin resistance. Thanks to an endorsement\nby WHO and international donor support, XPert MTB/\nRIF is increasingly available even at remote hospitals in\nrural areas.\n\nMycobacterial cultures of the sputum should be done but\nresults will take several weeks, too long to guide the clini-\ncian’s imminent decision.\n\nIdeally, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should\nbe done and material assessed for MM. tuberculosis (PCR, cul-\nture, microscopy) and Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCR, micros-\ncopy). Pulmonary Kaposi’s sarcoma could also be diagnosed\non endoscopy.\n\nUrine lipoarabinomannan (urine-LAM) is a simple\nlateral-flow assay helpful to look for TB in patients with\nadvanced immunosuppression (CD4 <100/l). A positive\ntest indicates disseminated TB with renal involvement.\n\nUltrasound is also very useful and simple to look for signs\nof extrapulmonary/disseminated TB in patients with\nadvanced immunosuppression. Simple and very useful algo-\nrithms have been published to guide clinicians not\nultrasound-experienced in the diagnosis of TB.\n\nIf none of these investigations is available, it is well justi-\nfiable to empirically start the patient on antituberculous\ntreatment, because sputum smear-negative TB is common\nand fatal if untreated. Adding prednisolone for the first\n4 weeks of antituberculous treatment has been shown to\nreduce the incidence of immune-reconstitution inflamma-\ntory syndrome (IRIS).\n\nAdditional antibiotic treatment should be considered in\nthis febrile patient with advanced immunosuppression. If\navailable, blood cultures should be taken in any febrile\npatient before starting antibiotic treatment. Also, adding\nhigh-dose co-trimoxazole to antituberculous therapy as pre-\nsumptive treatment for PCP has to be considered if the\npatient does not clinically improve. The optimal timing\nto initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) is within the first\n8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within\nthe first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts\n<50 cells/pl.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nInduced sputum results came back negative for AFB and\nthere was no sputum PCR available. The patient’s exercise\ntest (walking down the hospital corridor three times at a fast\npace) showed oxygen saturation of 98% as opposed to 97%\nat rest, and was therefore negative.", "summary": null}}

Both diarrhoea and skin changes of various aetiol-\nogies commonly occur in HIV infection.\n\nA further differential diagnosis to consider in a patient\nwith photosensitive dermatitis, anaemia and neuropsychiat-\nric changes is systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\n\nEven though the clinical presentation is very typical of pel-\nlagra, other differential diagnoses should actively be ruled\nout: A diagnostic HIV test should be carried out. The fact\nthat the patient is currently unable to receive counselling\nand give her consent should not lead to a delay of testing\nbecause its result determines immediate further manage-\nment. Once confusion has settled, the HIV test should be\nrepeated to include a pre- and post-counselling session. In\ncase of a reactive HIV serology, a lumbar puncture should\nbe done to rule out tuberculous or cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nA full blood count would help assess the cause of the\npatient’s clinical anaemia. If normocytic anaemia is found,\ncreatinine should be checked, because chronic kidney disease\nis very commonly seen in the tropics. Patients often present\nlate, and both confusion and dermatitis can be signs of\nuraemia.\n\nIn case of a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia patients\nshould be treated with iron and possibly also receive folic acid\nsubstitution, because a poor diet usually is not limited to just\none nutritional component. B-thalassaemia, commonly seen\nin tropical countries, also presents with microcytic anaemia\nand should be considered if there is no response to iron\n\nsupplementation. In f-thalassaemia the so-called Mentzer\nindex (MCV [fL] : Erythrocyte count [x 10'7/L}) is typically\nbelow 13; in iron deficiency it is above 13.\n\nIntestinal helminth infection can contribute to anaemia.\nBecause reliable stool microscopy may not be feasible in a\nresource-constrained setting, pragmatic anthelmintic treat-\nment appears justifiable. Vitamin B; (niacin) should be sup-\nplemented and it should be evaluated how the family’s diet\ncould be improved despite their poor socioeconomic circum-\nstances. A simple affordable trick is to advise the patient to\neat some of the maize directly from the cob, because it is\nthe husks that harbour tryptophan and that go lost during\npreparation of white maize flour.\n\nIt is a slight irony in this case that the husband is working\nona local chicken farm and still cannot afford a balanced diet\nthat includes eggs and poultry for his family.\n\nThe Case Continued...\nThe HIV test came back negative. The full blood count\n\nshowed a microcytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 6.7 g/\ndL and a Mentzer index >13. The patient received an appro-\npriate dose of vitamin B-complex, iron and folic acid supple-\nmentation and a single dose of albendazole. Her confusion\nsettled within a week and the diarrhoea stopped. The patient\nand her family received dietary counselling. She was pre-\nscribed soothing applications for her skin lesions and was\ntold to avoid sun exposure. She was discharged and asked\nto come back at 3 months for an outpatient follow-up visit\nincluding a repeat full blood count.\n\nALY) G\n\nPellagra\n\nPellagra is a nutritional disorder caused by the deficiency of\nvitamin Bg or its precursor, the essential amino-acid tryptophan.\n‘Pellagra’ is derived from the Italian pelle agra, meaning ‘rough\nskin’. It continues to be a problem in central and southern Africa\nwhere maize is the main staple food. Maize is poor in tryptophan,\nwhich is required for niacin synthesis. In some parts of Africa white\nmaize is mainly consumed, which is nutritionally poorer than the\nyellow maize used in this region as animal feed. Milling maize and\nremoving its husks further deprives it of nutritious components. In\nmany poor African countries with little crop diversity, diet may\nliterally consist of just maize, whereas niacin-containing food\nitems such as fresh fruits, vegetables, peanuts, fish, meat, milk\nand eggs are not affordable. Most nutritional disorders peak\nduring the rainy season, including kwashiorkor and marasmus in\nchildren. Apart from a poor diet, pellagra may be caused by\nmalabsorption, alcoholism, antituberculous treatment and other\naetiologies. The roll-out of INH-preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV\npatients has led to an increase in pellagra cases in some areas in\nAfrica. Single cases of pellagra continue to be described from all\nover the world.\n\nPatients present with the three ‘Ds’ of dermatitis, diarrhoea\nand dementia. The dermatitis often presents in a typical shape\naround the neck, which is referred to as ‘Casal’s necklace’ after\nthe Spanish physician who first described it in poor peasants in\nthe 18th century. The skin tends to be dry, tender to touch and\nexposure to sunlight may be very painful.", "summary": null}}

The fact that the cyanosis has started well\nafter birth along with the sudden onset of symptoms and the\nabsence of a heart murmur suggests that congenital heart dis-\nease is unlikely. Absence of fever or bulging fontanels makes\nmeningitis unlikely. The combination of dyspnoea, poor\nbreastfeeding, abnormal cry, grunting and swollen extremi-\nties in a suitable endemic setting (South-east Asia) suggest\ninfantile beriberi as the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Additional Information Do You Need to\nObtain from the Mother and What Would be Your\nImmediate Management?\n\nThe most important information to be obtained from the\nmother is whether the child has been exclusively breastfed,\nwhether the mother had practiced food avoidance during\npregnancy and/or post-partum, and whether the mother her-\nself has had any symptoms and signs suggestive of beriberi,\nsuch as paresthesias and difficulty rising from a squatting\nposition.\n\nProlonged food avoidance post-partum is common in\nlowland Lao culture.

A repeat FNA should be per-\nformed to check for AFB. A Gram stain and bacterial\nculture should help rule out bacterial superinfection. Ideally,\nthe aspirate should be examined by PCR (XPert MTB/RIF)\nand also be cultured to rule out infection with resistant Myco-\nbacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria (culture).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient denied missing any tablets, had no diarrhoea or\nother gastrointestinal symptoms, and had not left Malawi,\nwhere multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. IRIS of\nthe paradoxical type was also considered to explain the lack\nof improvement (see Box), therefore corticosteroids were\ninitiated.\n\nFurther investigations were done, with the following\nresults: CD4 109 cells/pL; HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL.\nRepeat FBC results were: WBC 7.8 x 10°/L, haemoglobin\n6.7 g/dL, MCV 84 fL, platelets 428 x 10°/L.\n\nBecause of the increasingly fluctuant swelling in the neck,\na second FNA was done, now showing frank yellowish pus.\nOn microscopic examination, numerous coccoid bacteria\nand polymorphonuclear lymphocytes were observed. Unfor-\ntunately results from a bacterial culture were never received.\n\nsto @lV NOME =i-ar-wae A 32-Year-Old Man from Malawi With a Painfully Swollen Neck\n\nThe diagnosis at this point was superimposed bacterial\nlymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic because of the earlier aspi-\nration, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most likely\nmicroorganism. The patient recovered well after incision\nand drainage, antibiotic treatment and a short course of cor-\nticosteroids while he continued on TB treatment and ART.\n\nIn the first full blood count, severe microcytic anaemia\nwas present. Anaemia is extremely common in patients with\nadvanced HIV immunosuppression and TB co-infection;\nhowever, the marked microcytosis is unusual. There was\nno good explanation for this finding because there was no\nsource of blood loss in the history, and the MCV had nor-\nmalized in the second full blood count, which was against\nB-thalassaemia as a cause of microcytic anaemia. The first full\nblood count also showed a leukocytosis when TB lymphad-\nenitis was diagnosed. This finding is paradoxical because\nlater, when the florid purulent bacterial infection was pre-\nsent, it had resolved. Multiple dynamic factors were appar-\nently influencing the white blood cell count in this\npatient, including HIV, TB, bacterial infection, immune\nreconstitution, corticosteroids, antiretroviral and antituber-\nculous drugs and co-trimoxazole.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome\n\nHIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\n(IRIS) is a deterioration of the clinical situation caused by\nincreased inflammation because of improving immune compe-\ntence resulting from successful ART.\n\nThe clinical manifestations are wide-ranging and depend on\nthe underlying condition, which is mostly an opportunistic infec-\ntion, but can also be a tumour, an autoimmune disease or another\ncondition. In sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculosis and cryptococcal\nmeningitis are the two most important IRIS presentations. IRIS is\nvery common, occurring in between 10 and 25% of patients who\nstart ART. There are no validated tests for IRIS. The diagnosis is\ntherefore clinical.\n\nA widely accepted definition does not exist, although stan-\ndardization has been attempted. Definitions include measures of\nsuccessful ART, exclusion of other causes of the clinical deteri-\noration, such as toxicity, and a relationship in time between the\nsymptoms and the start of ART.\n\nIRIS is classified into two types: In “unmasking IRIS”, a con-\ndition is present but remains subclinical and undiagnosed\nbecause of severe immunosuppression before the start of ART,\nand becomes clinically apparent within 6 months after ART initi-\nation. In “paradoxical IRIS”, a condition has been diagnosed and\nis being treated successfully, but clinical worsening occurs\nbecause of the increased inflammation after immune recovery,\ne.g. after starting ART. Risk factors for HIV-associated para-\ndoxical IRIS include a low pre-ART CD4 count and haemoglobin\nlevel, a high pre-ART viral load, large pre-ART weight loss, large\nand rapid increase of the CD4 count, rapid reduction of the viral\nload on ART and a short period between the start of treatment for\nan opportunistic infection and initiation of ART. Prednisone initi-\nated alongside ART in selected patients with CD4 counts <100\ncells/uL seems to reduce the risk of paradoxical IRIS and is not\nassociated with significant adverse effects.\n\nParadoxical IRIS may also occur in other conditions, e.g. in TB\nalone without HIV co-infection when TB treatment itself induces\nimmune reconstitution. Patients have to be prepared for the IRIS\nphenomenon when starting treatment.", "summary": null}}

CE cyst content was removed from the common\nbile duct and the bile flow was restored. The patient’s cho-\nlangitis was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.\nOnce the inflammation settled, the patient was referred\nfor surgery and partial cystectomy was performed on\nboth cysts.\n\nThe patient has been followed up for 9 years after surgery\nand has had no recurrence. He is considered cured and fur-\nther follow-up visits are not needed.\n\nThis case illustrates several learning points. In countries\nwith low CE-endemicity provenance from a hyperendemic\nregion is the single most important risk factor for CE in cystic\nliver lesions.\n\nCE is generally a benign disease with the exception of\ncomplicated cysts; in this case a cyst with biliary fistula.\nCE cysts are currently classified by the WHO into six stages:\nCE] and 2 (active), CE3a and 3b (transitional) and CE4 and\n5 (inactive).\n\nA very important question is which cysts can be left\nuntreated and only observed (‘watch and wait’). There is\nfairly solid evidence that inactive CE4 and CE5 cysts can\nbe left untreated if they are not in critical sites.\n\nIn this patient the cyst walls of both cysts (CE1, CE3b)\nwere calcified (Figs. 50.1 and 50.2). Previously, calcification\nwas described only as a feature of CE5 cysts; this was later\nextended to CE4 cysts and has now been shown to occur\nin all cyst stages.\n\nRetrospectively this case illustrates that surgical treatment\nwas rightly offered to the patient at initial diagnosis.", "summary": null}}

The patient’s complaints\nare very compatible with intestinal capillariasis, and she\nresides in an endemic area. In contrast to most other intes-\ntinal helminths, C. philippinensis is able to multiply within\nthe intestine of its final host causing long-lasting infection\nand severe clinical manifestations.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhere Does this Parasite Occur and How is it\nTransmitted?\n\nC. philippinensis is endemic in various East and South-east\nAsian countries such as The Philippines, Thailand, Laos,\nChina, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Furthermore, cases have\nbeen reported from Egypt, Iran and India. Sporadic cases\nmay occur elsewhere. One indigenous case has been reported\nfrom Cuba and another patient acquired the infection most\nprobably in Colombia. Capillariasis is transmitted through\nconsumption of raw or undercooked fish.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was admitted to hospital. Albendazole was\ninitiated at a dose of 400mg bd and continued for\n3 weeks. Oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes were\ngiven for resuscitation, and she received a high protein\ndiet and vitamins. During the first days of treatment,\nnumerous adult helminths (length 3-5 mm) were found\nin more stool samples (Fig. 58.2). The patient’s general\ncondition improved significantly within the first week\nand vomiting stopped. Diarrhoea subsided after 2 weeks\nof treatment.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nIntestinal Capillariasis\n\nIntestinal capillariasis is a zoonotic disease caused by C. philip-\npinensis, a tiny nematode usually infecting fish-eating birds, which\n\n \n\n° Fig. 58.2 Adult C. philippinensis in the patient’s stool sample during\ntreatment with mebendazole.\n\nrecently has been transferred to the genus Paracapillaria.\nHumans are accidentally infected when eating raw or under-\ncooked small fresh- or brackish-water fish harbouring infective\nlarval stages of the parasite. Adult parasites invade the wall of the\nsmall intestine and live partially embedded in the mucosa of\njejunum and ileum. The unique life cycle includes an alteration of\noviparous and larviparous females. Oviparous females shed\nthick-shelled eggs, which exit the body with the stool and, after\nbeing eaten by small fish, develop into the infective larvae. Lar-\nviparous females contain thin-shelled eggs, which mainly hatch\nin utero and permit an internal autoinfection and multiplication\ncycle, i.e. larvae develop into adults within the intestinal mucosa\nwithout leaving the host. This leads to a gradual increase of both\nworm burden and severity of clinical manifestations. With its\nautoinfection cycle, the parasite is one of the few intestinal hel-\nminths causing chronic and life-threatening infections. Patients\npresent with colicky abdominal pain and intermittent or chronic\ndiarrhoea accompanied by anorexia, vomiting and dehydration.\nWithout treatment, infection progresses to severe enteropathy\nwith crypt atrophy and flattening of villi. Chronically infected\npatients suffer cachexia and pitting oedema of the lower limbs.\nUntreated, they may eventually die of severe protein loss, elec-\ntrolyte imbalance and concomitant bacterial infections. Parasi-\ntological diagnosis relies on the demonstration of typical peanut-\nshaped eggs in stool samples, which have protruding polar plugs\non both ends and measure 36 to 42 x 20 pm. Treatment is with\nmebendazole or albendazole for 20 or 10 days, respectively.", "summary": null}}

The onset of symp-\ntoms coincides with a period of drought when diet mainly\nconsists of grass peas. There is no sensory deficit and no blad-\nder dysfunction. Another young male farmer from the same\nvillage is similarly affected.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Clinical Syndrome Can You Apply for a\nDiagnostic Approach and How Do You Narrow\nDown Possible Differential Diagnoses?\n\nUpper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis is the cli-\nnical syndrome. Absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level,\nsphincter disturbance, back pain, non-progression, HIV-\nseronegativity and negative family history rule out most com-\npressive, hereditary, infectious and metabolic myelopathies.\n\nAmong tropical myelopathies, HTLV-associated myelop-\nathy (HAM) is highly unlikely. HAM has usually an insid-\nious onset and a slowly progressive course, bladder\nimpairment and sensory symptoms are prominent. Neuro-\ncassavism (konzo) may also present with a sudden-onset spas-\ntic paraparesis but is improbable in the absence of cassava\nexposure. Male gender, pre-onset physical exertion, excessive\nprolonged guaya consumption and a history of similarly\naffected village members favour a distinct form of toxico-\nnutritional disease called neurolathyrism.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Management and Disease Prevention Plans\nCan be Employed?\n\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable neurotoxic myelopathy\nleading to permanent disability. Treatment is symptomatic\nwith anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy. Tendon and\n\nmuscle release surgery can be employed to lengthen contrac-\ntures of calf muscles and hip adductors. Walking canes, foot\nbraces and wheelchairs need to be provided.\n\nEducation to avoid consumption of L. sativus and mea-\nsures to reduce toxin burden are important public health\ninterventions. New cases of this preventable disease continue\nto occur. Behaviour change communication among high-risk\ncommunities can promote positive practices to reduce toxin\nexposure. Such practices include the use of metallic cooking\nutensils rather than traditional clay pots to avoid accrued tox-\nicity from iron-induced oxidation, addition of antioxidant\nseasonings, soaking seeds in lemon water and avoiding\nunripe seeds.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient received physiotherapy and muscle relaxants;\nhowever, this achieved only mild short-lasting improvement\nof his spasticity. A walking cane and wheelchair were pro-\nvided. The patient was counselled to avoid further consump-\ntion of L. sativus.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nNeurolathyrism\n\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by\nexcessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea. Clinical\npresentation is an irreversible acute to subacute spastic\nparaparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory\ninvolvement. Bladder and bowel function are maintained.\n\nL. sativus is a hardy, high-yield pest- and insect-resistant\ncash crop that can endure monsoon, drought or water-logging.\nIt has been consumed in ancient Egypt, Europe, South Asia\nand in the northern highlands of Ethiopia. Currently more than\n100 million people in drought- and monsoon-prone areas use\nL. sativus as staple crop. Being a multipurpose legume, it\nmakes a protein-rich, filling diet. It is an ‘almost perfect’ crop,\nwere it not for causing disability.

There is renal angle tenderness, and his kidneys appear\nenlarged. His creatinine is very high and he is hyperkalaemic.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat Is Your Clinical Impression?\n\nThis young man presents with combined left-sided cardiac\nfailure and renal failure. He was diagnosed with hypertension\n2 years prior. It is unclear if his renal incompetence is a cause\nor the result of his raised blood pressure.\n\nThe reason for the enlargement of his kidneys could either\nbe primary (e.g. polycystic kidneys) or secondary as a result of\npost-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis. In renal com-\npromise secondary to hypertension, one would expect the\nkidneys to be small.\n\nBeing a fisherman, the patient has been in regular contact\nwith Schistosoma haematobium-infested water in Lake\nMalawi. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis is\none of the top differential diagnoses to suspect.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Further Investigations Would You Like to\nPerform to Establish the Diagnosis?\n\nThe most useful investigation at this point is an ultrasound of\nthe kidneys to differentiate between, primary renal patholog-\nical condition and a post-renal problem. If there was hydro-\nnephrosis, obstruction at the level of the bladder seems most\nlikely because both kidneys appear enlarged.\n\nOn cystoscopy, endoscopists can macroscopically estab-\nlish the diagnosis, but ideally, biopsies should be performed\nto look for evidence of granulomatous inflammation and S.\nhaematobium ova in the tissue and to rule out neoplasia. In\nchronic infection, urine microscopy may be negative for ova\nof S. haematobium.\n\nThe Case Continued. . .\n\nDespite high doses of furosemide, the patient remained\noliguric. Glucose and insulin were administered for his\nhyperkalaemia.\n\nUltrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis with massive\ndilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The remaining renal\nparenchyma was very thin in both kidneys.\n\nCystoscopy revealed a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple\n‘sandy patches’ suggestive of granulomatous lesions in the\nmucosa. No tumour was seen. An endoscopic diagnosis of uro-\ngenital schistosomiasis was made. Histology was not available.\n\n \n\nFig. 7.2 Cystoscopy findings of a patient with urogenital schistosomia-\nsis. The white arrows show ‘sandy patches’ (left) and hyperaemia of the\nbladder mucosa (top). (Courtesy Iran Mendonga da Silva.)\n\nThe next day the patient deteriorated. He became drowsy\nand vomited repeatedly. He got progressively bradycardic,\nand there was a new pericardial friction rub suggestive of\nuraemic pericarditis.\n\nHe was taken to theatre and a bilateral percutaneous\nnephrostomy was done. The patient was transferred to the\nintensive care unit and peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started\n(haemodialysis was not available).\n\nThe patient improved rapidly, vomiting and drowsiness\nceased and his friction rub disappeared. He was discharged\nhome on PD.\n\nTwo months later he was readmitted with fever and\nabdominal pain. He was treated for suspected bacterial peri-\ntonitis but sadly died 3 weeks later still in the hospital.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nGenitourinary Schistosomiasis\n\nGenitourinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma\nhaematobium is endemic in large parts of Africa and in the Middle\nEast. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common tropical\ndiseases in migrants from endemic countries and should actively\nbe screened for.\n\nAbout 50% of Schistosoma eggs are shed through urine,\nthe other half remain trapped in the tissue causing\ngranulomatous inflammation. Around 10% of people infected\nprogress to chronic late-stage disease. Risk factors for disease\nprogression are poorly understood and include intensity and\nduration of infection, host genetic factors and parasite strain\ndifferences.\n\nChronic infection leads to granulomatous inflammation of\nbladder wall and ureteral mucosa resulting in obstructive\nuropathy, hydronephrosis, recurrent bacterial pyelonephritis and\nend-stage renal disease. It is also suspected to contribute to\nthe development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.\nThe pathological changes can long go unnoticed.\n\nEgg deposition in the female genital tract may result in\ndyspareunia, chronic lower abdominal pain, ectopic pregnancy\nand infertility and has also been associated with an increased risk\nof HIV infection. Men may present with scrotal swelling, orchitis\nand prostatitis, haematospermia and oligospermia.", "summary": null}}

CSF shows slight lymphocytic\npleocytosis, a mildly raised protein and a slightly decreased\nglucose. Brain CT scan shows no abnormalities.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Clinical Sign Will You be Specifically\nLooking for?\n\nLymphadenopathy in the right axilla was detected on clinical\nexamination of the patient. Her acute presentation with\nsigns of severe sepsis make an infectious aetiology of the\nregional lymphadenopathy most likely. It is crucial to per-\nform a meticulous examination in order to establish the port\nof entry of the microorganisms, which should be found in the\nskin area that drains to the enlarged regional lymph nodes.\n\nIn Asia, infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causa-\ntive pathogen of scrub typhus, is a common cause of\nfever, which is often associated with an eschar at the inocu-\nlation site and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes.\nHowever, the prevalence of eschar varies in different popula-\ntions and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis of scrub\n\ntyphus.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Antibiotic Would You Include in Your\nEmpirical Regimen?\n\nIn Asia, scrub typhus must be considered in every patient\npresenting with an undifferentiated febrile illness, regardless\nof the presence or absence of an eschar.\n\nTherefore doxycycline should be added to the empirical\nregimen to cover for O. tsutsugamushi infection. Doxycycline\nwould also cover important differential diagnoses such as\nother rickettsial infections and leptospirosis.\n\nChloramphenicol or azithromycin is the accepted alterna-\ntive treatment if tetracyclines are contraindicated, as is the\ncase in pregnant women or patients with tetracycline hyper-\nsensitivity. Children at any age with scrub typhus can be\nsafely treated with doxycycline.\n\nOf note, acute hearing loss or hearing impairment in a\nfebrile patient from Asia should always arouse strong suspi-\ncion of scrub typhus. However, no single clinical sign or lab-\noratory test can rule in or rule out scrub typhus; therefore\nempirical antirickettsial treatment is given based on clinical\nand epidemiological evidence. A definitive laboratory diag-\nnosis — if at all possible in the particular setting — can be\nestablished by demonstration of seroconversion in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples or by PCR on pre-\ntreatment buffy coat samples of an eschar biopsy.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nOn day 2 after admission the patient developed coarse\ntremors of both upper and lower limbs associated with sac-\ncadic oscillations of her eyes in all directions with further\ndeterioration of level of consciousness (GCS 8). At this point\na careful clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated\ncrater-like lesion in the right axilla hidden within the axillary\nfolds. Doxycycline therapy was commenced and the patient\nimproved over the next 48 hours. She was discharged on day\n6 after admission. Her hearing had returned to normal and\nthere were no other neurological deficits.\n\nThe patient’s O. tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre came back\nhigh (>1:4096), supporting the suspected diagnosis of scrub\ntyphus.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nScrub Typhus\n\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of\nAsia and northern Australia. Its epidemiology has long been\nconsidered limited to the Asia-Pacific area but in 2016 was also\nfirst described in patients from South America.\n\nScrub typhus belongs to the tropical rickettsial\ninfections and is caused by O. tsutsugamushi. The infection is\ntransmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a\ntrombiculid mite.\n\nInfected mite larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats,\nfrom scrubs and primary forests to gardens, beaches, bamboo\nfields and oil palm or rubber estates. Reservoirs of O. tsutsu-\ngamushi are rodents and the mites themselves, which can\nmaintain the infection by vertical transmission. Humans are\naccidental hosts.\n\nThe incubation period is 6 to 10 days. A painless papule\noccurs at the site of the bite, which later ulcerates and trans-\nforms into a black crust or ‘eschar’. Patients present with fever,\nsevere headache and myalgia, regional or generalized lymph-\nadenopathy and, at times, a macular or maculopapular rash.\nConjunctival suffusions, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as\nconstipation can occur.\n\nCNS involvement is common in scrub typhus, and\npresentations with diffuse encephalopathy or a reversible sen-\nsorineural deafness are well documented. In contrast, focal\nneurological signs are rare. Cerebellar, brainstem and extrapy-\nramidal manifestations have been reported, including opsoclo-\nnus, myoclonus and parkinsonian tremor. Further complications\ninclude myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS and renal\nfailure. Immunity is short-lived and strain-specific.\n\nDiagnosis can be challenging and, in many resource-limited\nsettings, remains clinical. The diagnostic gold standard is the\ndocumentation of a significant rise in antibody titres in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples. However, these\nserological tests are usually unavailable in resource-poor\ntropical areas. Despite controversies in sensitivity and speci-\nficity, inmunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests have\nbeen developed for field use and are being used in the diag-\nnosis of scrub typhus in several endemic countries. ELISA-\nbased tests have a high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-based\ntests have been developed and are mostly employed in\ngenotypic characterization and for research purposes or as\ndiagnostic tools in high-resource settings. Culture of O. tsut-\nsugamushi from the blood takes several weeks and requires a\nbiosafety level 3 facility.", "summary": null}}

Therefore\ndiagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main hel-\nminth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wast-\ning are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis\n(see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal\nprotozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli\nmight cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated\nfrom northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for\nS. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be\nordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae\nof S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann\n\ntechnique should be performed. The latter has the advantage\nof being technically simple and providing results within a few\nhours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and\nurine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWould You Order Any Additional Investigations?\n\nBecause S. stercoralis is the most probable cause of this severe\ndisease, serology for HTLV-1 should be ordered. HTLV-1 is\nan important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syn-\ndrome, and Peru is endemic for this retrovirus. The family\nhistory of the patient also hints at this virus that is commonly\ntransmitted by breastfeeding.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptom-\natic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopa-\nthology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent\nto the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which\ndemonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercor-\nalis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respi-\nratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral\ntreatment with ivermectin (200 jig/kg per day x 7 days)\nwas initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-\ninfection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered\nfrom diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within\nweeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months\nwas negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and\nwas without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first\ntime in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of the family\nand other household members revealed asymptomatic\nS. stercoralis infection of his wife and one of the two children.\nHis wife tested HTLV-1 positive, but both children were\n\nnegative.\n\n \n\n° Fig. 79.2 (A) Baermann technique showing high load of motile rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis in a stool\nsample.

This lesion\nmay look similar to an eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in\ncutaneous anthrax, yet the absence of systemic symptoms\nrenders these differentials unlikely. The clinical presentation\nsuggests a topical process.\n\nSpider bites may cause lesions with an eschar-like central\nnecrosis (e.g. the brown recluse spider); however, the slow\ngrowth of the lesion over several weeks makes this differential\nunlikely.\n\nLocalized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as\nfolliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles or abscesses are very com-\nmon among backpacking travellers.

Imaging reveals an elongated structure\nin the right occipital lobe. During neurosurgery, a live\nworm-like structure is removed from the brain, identified\nas a sparganum.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat is the Cause of Sparganosis?\n\nSpargana are the larvae of zoonotic tapeworms of the genus\nSpirometra. Adult worms inhabit the intestines of cats and\ndogs, and produce eggs that are discharged in faeces. In fresh\nwater, coracidia hatch from the eggs to be ingested by cope-\npods and develop into first stage (procercoid) larvae.\n\nWhen copepods are ingested by the second intermediate\nhost (e.g. frogs, fish, snakes, birds), the procercoid larvae\nmature into plerocercoid sparganum larvae and migrate to\nthe muscle and subcutaneous tissue. The cycle is completed\nwhen a carnivorous mammal eats the second intermediate\nhost.\n\nHumans can become infected by ingesting the first or sec-\nond intermediate host, i.e. by drinking water containing\ninfected copepods, eating undercooked meat from infected\nsnakes, frogs, or birds, or by the use of poultices produced\nfrom infested frog or snake flesh or skin on open wounds\nor eyes.\n\nIn the human body, the sparganum commonly migrates\ninto subcutaneous tissue or muscle, and sometimes into the\neye, the spinal cord or brain, the latter resulting in cerebral\nsparganosis. The infection route in the present case was prob-\nably through consumption of raw chicken meat, which the\npatient ate approximately once a month before the general-\nized seizure.", "summary": null}}

She has a widespread non-blanching\npurpuric rash.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Differential Diagnosis and What\nEmpirical Treatment Would You Give?\n\nThe patient presented at the rural district hospital with fever\nand malaise and developed confusion. There is malaria in\nrural Vietnam and both P. falciparum and P. vivax are\nendemic; therefore severe malaria must be excluded. Enteric\nfever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries,\ncan cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of\ndisease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue\nfever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be con-\nsidered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with tran-\nsient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse\nerythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small propor-\ntion of patients develop severe disease during a second,\nimmune-mediated phase (usually on day 4-6). This phase\nmay be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous\nbleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as\nencephalitis.\n\nIn this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningi-\ntis and shock is not typical for dengue.\n\nMelioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider.\nIn some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause\n\nxt: Gey Noe =taenstom A 55-Year-Old Female Pig Farmer from Vietnam With Fever and Impaired Consciousness\n\nof community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a\nrisk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain\nabscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is compara-\ntively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease\nremains to be elucidated.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis though seems to be acute bac-\nterial meningitis complicated by septic shock. Globally, the\ncommon causes of acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus\npneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influen-\nzae. Both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis infections can\nbe complicated by development of a purpuric rash; this is\nmore common with NV. meningitidis septicemia.\n\nIn Vietnam, however, the commonest identified cause of\nacute bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus suis. Like\nits counterparts, S. swis infection can cause both meningitis\nand septic shock; the syndromes overlap. A florid purpuric\nrash is common (6%-31% of patient cases).\n\nOther forms of meningitis seen in Asia and the tropics\ninclude tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. Although\neach of these tends to have a more insidious onset, the dura-\ntion of symptoms before presentation can be as short as 4 to\n5 days; these diagnoses therefore should always be considered.\nHowever, they are not associated with shock or purpuric rash.\n\nMeningitis is a medical emergency requiring prompt\ntreatment. Lumbar puncture is the investigation of choice\nbut should not delay administration of broad-spectrum\nintravenous antibiotics. A typical choice is ceftriaxone; where\nresistance is suspected or common epidemiologically, vanco-\nmycin is also administered. The value of adjunctive cortico-\nsteroids in acute bacterial meningitis is difficult to generalize.\nLarge studies in Africa found no benefit; this contrasts with\n‘Western Europe, where steroids reduced the risk of death,\nand Vietnam, where in microbiologically confirmed disease\nthey reduced the risk of complications.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWhat Additional Investigations are Needed?\n\nThe patient requires a lumbar puncture and blood cultures.\nCSF should be sent for microscopy, Gram stain, cell count,\nprotein, glucose and culture. A simultaneous blood glucose\nmeasurement should be performed. If resources are limited,\nthen CSF glucose with simultaneous blood glucose is the\nmost important test informing clinical management, because\nanormal ratio (i.e. a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.6) excludes\nacute bacterial meningitis and TB. In both bacterial and Tb\nmeningitis, the CSF/serum glucose ratio is expected to be\nmarkedly diminished. Rapid diagnostic tests such as pneu-\nmococcal antigen can be performed on CSF, blood or urine,\nand meningococcal polymerase chain reaction on blood or\nCSF if available. Because the patient is from a malaria-\nendemic area, the blood film should be repeated.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient received empirical treatment with intravenous\nceftriaxone and vancomycin, and supportive treatment\nincluding intravenous fluids.

Laboratory results indicate liver failure.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat is your differential diagnosis?\n\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that pro-\nduces liver failure. Severe malaria is a possibility, although\ntransaminases are usually not so high. The differential diag-\nnosis includes viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E) and toxin-\nmediated hepatitis.\n\nLeptospirosis seems possible, but the transaminases in lep-\ntospirosis are usually only mildly elevated (less than 200 U/L)\nand jaundice is caused by cholestasis rather than hepatocel-\nlular damage. Typhoid fever and brucellosis are other bacte-\nrial infections to be taken into account.\n\nSevere dengue has to be considered, although 8 days of fever\nappears long for dengue and usually jaundice is not so prominent.\nAlso, haematocrit would be increased rather than low, as in\nthis case.\n\nOther viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) with jaundice are\npossible, particularly given his occupation as a logger in the\nPeruvian jungle with possible contact to sylvatic mosquitoes\nand animals. The most prominent VHF in Peru is yellow fever\nand he does not appear to be vaccinated against this disease.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Tests Will You Do to Confirm the Diagnosis?\n\nSerial thick blood smears for malaria should be ordered.\nDengue NS1 and dengue IgM should be performed\n\n(because NS1 might have turned negative after more than\n1 week of illness).\n\nBlood cultures should be done to look for Brucella species,\nas well as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi. If brucellosis is sus-\npected, microbiologists must be informed because specimens\nhave to be handled under special biosafety precautions to\nprevent laboratory infections.\n\nIf available, PCR of urine and blood should be done to\nlook for leptospirosis; microscopic agglutination test is an\nalternative if PCR is not available.\n\nLaboratory tests should include IgM antibodies for the\ndifferent viral hepatitis viruses (except for acute hepatitis\nD because of delayed antibody production).\n\nIgM antibodies against the yellow fever virus persist for\nseveral weeks and can be detected by various methods, e.g.\nIgM capture ELISA. Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR\ncould also be attempted.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient received presumptive treatment for malaria,\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. Over the\nnext 3 days, he developed increasing hepatic encephalopathy,\nrenal failure, coma, and DIC with increasing spontaneous\nbleeding. The chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infil-\ntrates compatible with ARDS (Fig. 93.2). Repeat laboratory\nresults on day 3 showed deterioration of his kidney function\n(creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL) and a sudden drop\nin his liver transaminases (AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L),\nmost likely indicating acute hepatic disintegration. Sadly,\nthe patient passed away 1 day later.\n\nIgM capture ELISA for yellow fever came back highly pos-\nitive at 1:10000. Anti-dengue IgM was negative. Direct viral\nisolation in culture was negative on a blood specimen drawn\non admission (8 days into the illness), which is not surprising\nbecause viraemia in yellow fever is short (4-5 days).
