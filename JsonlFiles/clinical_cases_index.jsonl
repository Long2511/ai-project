She was evacuated to the regional hospital.\nIn the clinic, microscopy of her skin scrapings under low-\npower magnification confirmed the diagnosis, showing\nmultiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs.\nIn the hospital, the patient was managed in a single room\nwith enhanced contact precautions to prevent transmission\nof scabies to staff and visitors.\n\nTreatment consisted of a five-dose course of ivermectin\n(200 g/kg/dose) on days 0, 1, 7, 8 and 14, together with a\ntopical scabicide (benzyl benzoate 25%) applied every second\nday for the first week; then twice weekly for the second week,\nwith a keratolytic cream (lactic acid and urea in sorbolene\ncream) after bathing on the days the topical scabicide was\nnot administered. Her blood cultures taken in the community\ngrew S. aureus resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin, but\nsensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline\n(ie. community-acquired MRSA). She was therefore given\n2 weeks of IV vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram\nshowed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures\n48 hours after admission were negative, and by that stage\nshe was afebrile, off oxygen and eating well. While she was\nin the hospital, all her family members were treated in the\ncommunity with topical permethrin 5%, given as two doses\n1 week apart, and the children with skin sores were each\ngiven a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin,\nwith excellent response.\n\n \n\n° Fig. 10.2 Fissure over the wrist with underlying less severe crusted\nscabies.\n\nThe household clothes, linen and furniture were put out\nin the sun for a day, and the rooms were treated with a com-\nmercial residual insecticide. The woman returned to the\ncommunity after 3 weeks in the hospital, with her skin show-\ning no residual hyperkeratosis or shedding. She and the fam-\nily are followed up regularly by the health staff to allow early\ndiagnosis and treatment should she again be infected with\nscabies.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nCrusted Scabies\n\nAlthough Sarcoptes scabiei infection and mite reproduction is\nusually self-limiting, hyperinfestation can develop in susceptible\nindividuals. Crusted or Norwegian scabies was first described\nin patients with leprosy in Norway. Crusted scabies can occur\nafter immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation, rheuma-\ntological conditions, chemotherapy for malignancy and in\ninfection with HIV and HTLV-1. It can also occur in malnutrition,\nDown’s syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized,\nespecially those with physical or cognitive disability who are\nunable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many\nthousands of mites in skin lesions and can serve as ‘core\ntransmitters’ for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities\nand nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are\n\nnot genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those\ninfected from these cases.\n\nCrusted scabies results from unfettered mite reproduction\nand host reaction, resulting in formation of hyperkeratotic skin\ncrusts that may be loose and flaky or thick and adherent. Skin\nflakes with thousands of mites can be shed onto bed linen and\nfloors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the\ndistribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp as\nwell as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and\nelbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath\nthe nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can\nbe limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary\nscabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is\nvariable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial\ninfection are common (Fig. 10.2). A peripheral blood eosinophilia\nis common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often\nextremely high. There is high mortality in crusted scabies cases\nfrom secondary bacterial sepsis, including with Gram-negative\norganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to\nS. pyogenes and/or S. aureus.\n\nThe differential diagnoses of crusted scabies include\npsoriasis, extensive tinea corporis, skin malignancies such as\nthe T-cell lymphomas mycosis fungoides and the Sézary\nsyndrome, nutritional deficiencies such as pellagra, pemphigus,\nkava dermopathy, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy and\nsecondary syphilis.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.

She was evacuated to the regional hospital.\nIn the clinic, microscopy of her skin scrapings under low-\npower magnification confirmed the diagnosis, showing\nmultiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs.\nIn the hospital, the patient was managed in a single room\nwith enhanced contact precautions to prevent transmission\nof scabies to staff and visitors.\n\nTreatment consisted of a five-dose course of ivermectin\n(200 g/kg/dose) on days 0, 1, 7, 8 and 14, together with a\ntopical scabicide (benzyl benzoate 25%) applied every second\nday for the first week; then twice weekly for the second week,\nwith a keratolytic cream (lactic acid and urea in sorbolene\ncream) after bathing on the days the topical scabicide was\nnot administered. Her blood cultures taken in the community\ngrew S. aureus resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin, but\nsensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline\n(ie. community-acquired MRSA). She was therefore given\n2 weeks of IV vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram\nshowed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures\n48 hours after admission were negative, and by that stage\nshe was afebrile, off oxygen and eating well. While she was\nin the hospital, all her family members were treated in the\ncommunity with topical permethrin 5%, given as two doses\n1 week apart, and the children with skin sores were each\ngiven a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin,\nwith excellent response.\n\n \n\n° Fig. 10.2 Fissure over the wrist with underlying less severe crusted\nscabies.\n\nThe household clothes, linen and furniture were put out\nin the sun for a day, and the rooms were treated with a com-\nmercial residual insecticide. The woman returned to the\ncommunity after 3 weeks in the hospital, with her skin show-\ning no residual hyperkeratosis or shedding. She and the fam-\nily are followed up regularly by the health staff to allow early\ndiagnosis and treatment should she again be infected with\nscabies.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nCrusted Scabies\n\nAlthough Sarcoptes scabiei infection and mite reproduction is\nusually self-limiting, hyperinfestation can develop in susceptible\nindividuals. Crusted or Norwegian scabies was first described\nin patients with leprosy in Norway. Crusted scabies can occur\nafter immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation, rheuma-\ntological conditions, chemotherapy for malignancy and in\ninfection with HIV and HTLV-1. It can also occur in malnutrition,\nDown’s syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized,\nespecially those with physical or cognitive disability who are\nunable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many\nthousands of mites in skin lesions and can serve as ‘core\ntransmitters’ for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities\nand nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are\n\nnot genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those\ninfected from these cases.\n\nCrusted scabies results from unfettered mite reproduction\nand host reaction, resulting in formation of hyperkeratotic skin\ncrusts that may be loose and flaky or thick and adherent. Skin\nflakes with thousands of mites can be shed onto bed linen and\nfloors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the\ndistribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp as\nwell as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and\nelbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath\nthe nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can\nbe limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary\nscabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is\nvariable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial\ninfection are common (Fig. 10.2). A peripheral blood eosinophilia\nis common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often\nextremely high. There is high mortality in crusted scabies cases\nfrom secondary bacterial sepsis, including with Gram-negative\norganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to\nS. pyogenes and/or S. aureus.\n\nThe differential diagnoses of crusted scabies include\npsoriasis, extensive tinea corporis, skin malignancies such as\nthe T-cell lymphomas mycosis fungoides and the Sézary\nsyndrome, nutritional deficiencies such as pellagra, pemphigus,\nkava dermopathy, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy and\nsecondary syphilis.", "Further Reading": "1.

Her HIV test should be repeated.\n\nSince she is symptomatic and has malaria parasites in her\nblood, she should receive antimalarials according to the\nnational guidelines and the local resistance profile. She\nshould also be given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover\nfor Gram-negative and, less likely, Gram-positive bacteria.\nA urinary dipstick could quickly help rule out a urinary tract\ninfection.\n\nAn abdominal ultrasound should be done to rule out post-\nhepatic causes of jaundice and to assess texture and size of\nliver and spleen.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nOn admission the patient was started on artemether/lume-\nfantrine PO and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone\n2g IV od). A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures\ngrew Salmonella Typhi. The antibiotic therapy was switched\nto ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid. On day 5 of antibiotic treat-\nment the patient’s fever started to settle and she was feeling\nbetter. She was discharged on day 7. Ciprofloxacin was con-\ntinued for a total of 10 days. The patient was also given one\ndose of praziquantel, because co-infection with schistosomi-\nasis seems to favour chronic carriage of S. Typhi and relapse,\nand Malawi is a country highly endemic for schistosomiasis.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\n \n\nTyphoid Fever\n\nTyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi is an exclusively\nhuman disease and there is no animal reservoir. Typhoid is clin-\nically indistinguishable from paratyphoid, caused by S. Paratyphi\nA, B and C.\n\nThe enteric fevers, typhoid and paratyphoid, are endemic all\nover the tropical world. Incidence appears to be highest on the\nIndian subcontinent (approx. 500:100 000 per year in urban\nslums).\n\nIn endemic countries, enteric fevers are most common in\nchildren and adolescents, whereas adults have acquired immunity\nthrough previous exposures. Typhoid is usually acquired through\ningestion of food or water contaminated by faeces of a patient or\ncarrier. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are major risk factors.\n\n \n\nThe incubation period of typhoid fever averages 10 to 20 days\n(range 3-56). It is shorter in paratyphoid (1-10 days).\n\nSymptoms are nonspecific with fever, headache, dry cough\nand abdominal pain. Other than in malaria, fever starts insidiously\nand may go unnoticed by the patient for some time. Temperature\ntypically rises in the evening hours and patients may be afebrile in\nthe morning. Constipation is common, but foul-smelling diarrhoea\nmay occur during the course of an untreated infection. Patients\nmay become confused and apathetic and, if untreated, may die of\nmyocarditis, overwhelming toxaemia, intestinal perforation or\nhaemorrhage.\n\nFull blood count typically shows leukopenia. Low-grade\nanaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as slightly elevated\ntransaminases are also common, but non-specific.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of typhoid requires proof of S. Typhi in\nblood cultures or bone marrow. Isolation from stool or urine\nindicates carrier state but does not prove disease. The serological\nWidal test lacks both sensitivity and specificity and should be\nabandoned altogether. Novel and more promising serological\ntests are under development. Meanwhile, blood culture remains\nthe diagnostic gold standard. In many low-resource settings,\nblood culture testing is however unavailable.\n\nPatients with suspected enteric fever should be started on\nempirical antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic resistance patterns vary\nconsiderably between endemic areas. In many countries, antibi-\notic resistance is on the rise.

Her HIV test should be repeated.\n\nSince she is symptomatic and has malaria parasites in her\nblood, she should receive antimalarials according to the\nnational guidelines and the local resistance profile. She\nshould also be given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover\nfor Gram-negative and, less likely, Gram-positive bacteria.\nA urinary dipstick could quickly help rule out a urinary tract\ninfection.\n\nAn abdominal ultrasound should be done to rule out post-\nhepatic causes of jaundice and to assess texture and size of\nliver and spleen.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nOn admission the patient was started on artemether/lume-\nfantrine PO and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone\n2g IV od). A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures\ngrew Salmonella Typhi. The antibiotic therapy was switched\nto ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid. On day 5 of antibiotic treat-\nment the patient’s fever started to settle and she was feeling\nbetter. She was discharged on day 7. Ciprofloxacin was con-\ntinued for a total of 10 days. The patient was also given one\ndose of praziquantel, because co-infection with schistosomi-\nasis seems to favour chronic carriage of S. Typhi and relapse,\nand Malawi is a country highly endemic for schistosomiasis.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nTyphoid Fever\n\nTyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi is an exclusively\nhuman disease and there is no animal reservoir. Typhoid is clin-\nically indistinguishable from paratyphoid, caused by S. Paratyphi\nA, B and C.\n\nThe enteric fevers, typhoid and paratyphoid, are endemic all\nover the tropical world. Incidence appears to be highest on the\nIndian subcontinent (approx. 500:100 000 per year in urban\nslums).\n\nIn endemic countries, enteric fevers are most common in\nchildren and adolescents, whereas adults have acquired immunity\nthrough previous exposures. Typhoid is usually acquired through\ningestion of food or water contaminated by faeces of a patient or\ncarrier. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are major risk factors.\n\n \n\nThe incubation period of typhoid fever averages 10 to 20 days\n(range 3-56). It is shorter in paratyphoid (1-10 days).\n\nSymptoms are nonspecific with fever, headache, dry cough\nand abdominal pain. Other than in malaria, fever starts insidiously\nand may go unnoticed by the patient for some time. Temperature\ntypically rises in the evening hours and patients may be afebrile in\nthe morning. Constipation is common, but foul-smelling diarrhoea\nmay occur during the course of an untreated infection. Patients\nmay become confused and apathetic and, if untreated, may die of\nmyocarditis, overwhelming toxaemia, intestinal perforation or\nhaemorrhage.\n\nFull blood count typically shows leukopenia. Low-grade\nanaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as slightly elevated\ntransaminases are also common, but non-specific.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of typhoid requires proof of S. Typhi in\nblood cultures or bone marrow. Isolation from stool or urine\nindicates carrier state but does not prove disease. The serological\nWidal test lacks both sensitivity and specificity and should be\nabandoned altogether. Novel and more promising serological\ntests are under development. Meanwhile, blood culture remains\nthe diagnostic gold standard. In many low-resource settings,\nblood culture testing is however unavailable.\n\nPatients with suspected enteric fever should be started on\nempirical antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic resistance patterns vary\nconsiderably between endemic areas. In many countries, antibi-\notic resistance is on the rise. Fluoroquinolones are the drugs of\nchoice in areas without antimicrobial resistance because they\nreach very high intracellular concentrations. Third-generation\ncephalosporins or azithromycin should be used in South Asia\nwhere fluoroquinolone resistance is common.\n\nDuration of treatment is between 1 and 2 weeks depending on\nthe drug used. Case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is <1%.\nApart from public health measures to improve safe water\nsupply and sanitation, targeted vaccination of high-risk popula-\ntions seems to be a promising strategy to control typhoid fever.\nTyphoid conjugate vaccines which can also be applied to children\n\n<2 years of age seem to be promising.", "Further Reading": "1\n\n.

In endemic areas, 60-80% of children have\nevidence of seroconversion to B. pseudomallei by the age of\n4 years and most paediatric infections are mild or asymptomatic.\n\nSepticaemic melioidosis occurs in more than one-third of\npaediatric cases, with a similar clinical presentation as in adults.\nThe lung is the most common organ involved, and septic shock is\nassociated with a high mortality. Multiple organ involvement and\ndisseminated infections are well described. Localized disease,\nhowever, accounts for the majority of paediatric melioidosis, with\nthe parotid gland being the most common site involved. Skin and\nsoft tissue abscesses are also common. Parotitis is uncommon in\nadults and has not been seen in children in Australia.\n\nIt is believed that ingestion of water contaminated with\nB. pseudomallei may cause colonization of the oropharynx and\nascending infection to the parotid gland, particularly where drinking\nwater is obtained from boreholes. Less than 10% of children havea\npredisposing condition. The prognosis is usually favourable,\nalthough complications include spontaneous rupture into the\nauditory canal, facial nerve palsy, septicaemia and osteomyelitis.\n\nThe aims of treatment are to reduce mortality and morbidity,\nprevent recurrence and drain abscesses.

In\nAfrica Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause\nof meningitis in adults and children. Additionally, in the\nmeningitis belt, seasonal outbreaks of bacterial meningitis\ncaused by Neisseria meningitis occur during the dry season.\nCase numbers have dropped considerably after the introduc-\ntion of large-scale vaccination programmes.\n\nThe immediate treatment priority is emergency resuscita-\ntion, including rapid administration of antibiotics. A third-\ngeneration cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone at a high dose to\npenetrate the CSF is appropriate; where this is not available,\nhigh dose benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol is a suitable\nalternative. Resistance rates of S. pneumoniae to both penicil-\nlins and chloramphenicol are rising, hence local advice about\nresistance patterns should be sought. Data to guide resusci-\ntation in adults are limited, but airway support and seizure\ncontrol are indicated. Public health services are required\nfor case management to ensure that appropriate vaccination\nprogrammes and case notification for outbreak monitoring\nare done.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Adjunctive Interventions Should be Used in\nThis Setting and What Are Your Differential\nDiagnoses?\n\nSeveral meta-analyses suggest that while in well-resourced\ncountries dexamethasone should be given to adults and chil-\ndren presenting to hospital with meningitis, steroids should\nnot be used in resource-limited hospitals in Africa given their\nlack of efficacy. Glycerol has been tested in paediatric men-\ningitis with mixed results but was shown to be harmful in\nadults with meningitis in Malawi. No other adjuncts have\nbeen tested in clinical trials to date; adjunctive treatment\nis not indicated.\n\nIn cases of suspected meningitis, a lumbar puncture (LP)\nmust be undertaken to obtain a diagnosis. Despite clinical\ncontraindications to lumbar puncture in this patient (sei-\nzures and altered conscious level), the risk of causing harm\nby doing an LP is low. LP should not be delayed by attempts\nto obtain cerebral imaging unless obvious signs of a space-\noccupying lesion are present. CT scan of the brain is of lim-\nited value in bacterial meningitis. Administration of antibi-\notics should not be delayed while the LP is undertaken,\nparticularly in resource-limited settings.\n\nThe main differential diagnoses for this patient are cryp-\ntococcal meningitis (CCM) and TB meningitis (TBM).\nHowever, her CD4 count is too high for CCM and her\nrecent completion of TB treatment makes TBM less likely.\nIn addition, both of these infections classically have a more\nchronic course.\n\nShe is not pregnant, therefore meningitis caused by Lis-\nteria monocytogenes is very unlikely. Bacterial pathogens that\ncause meningitis in HIV-infected adults include S. pneumo-\nniae, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, invasive\nnon-typhoidal salmonellae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli\nand. Haemophilus influenzae; all will be treated with a third-\ngeneration cephalosporin. European guidelines recommend\n14 days of antibiotics in HIV-infected adults with bacterial\nmeningitis. However, in sub-Saharan Africa often shorter\ncourses are given, determined by the patient’s recovery rate,\nlocal guidelines and availability of antibiotics for long\ncourses. In children with bacterial meningitis in Malawi,\n5 days of ceftriaxone was shown to be non-inferior to ten\ndays, with substantial savings shown, and shorter courses\nare now commonly used.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nIn the emergency department the patient received ceftriax-\none 2g IV, 10 mg of diazepam IV and 600 mg of phenobar-\nbitone IV.

In\nAfrica Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause\nof meningitis in adults and children. Additionally, in the\nmeningitis belt, seasonal outbreaks of bacterial meningitis\ncaused by Neisseria meningitis occur during the dry season.\nCase numbers have dropped considerably after the introduc-\ntion of large-scale vaccination programmes.\n\nThe immediate treatment priority is emergency resuscita-\ntion, including rapid administration of antibiotics. A third-\ngeneration cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone at a high dose to\npenetrate the CSF is appropriate; where this is not available,\nhigh dose benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol is a suitable\nalternative. Resistance rates of S. pneumoniae to both penicil-\nlins and chloramphenicol are rising, hence local advice about\nresistance patterns should be sought. Data to guide resusci-\ntation in adults are limited, but airway support and seizure\ncontrol are indicated. Public health services are required\nfor case management to ensure that appropriate vaccination\nprogrammes and case notification for outbreak monitoring\nare done.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Adjunctive Interventions Should be Used in\nThis Setting and What Are Your Differential\nDiagnoses?\n\nSeveral meta-analyses suggest that while in well-resourced\ncountries dexamethasone should be given to adults and chil-\ndren presenting to hospital with meningitis, steroids should\nnot be used in resource-limited hospitals in Africa given their\nlack of efficacy. Glycerol has been tested in paediatric men-\ningitis with mixed results but was shown to be harmful in\nadults with meningitis in Malawi. No other adjuncts have\nbeen tested in clinical trials to date; adjunctive treatment\nis not indicated.\n\nIn cases of suspected meningitis, a lumbar puncture (LP)\nmust be undertaken to obtain a diagnosis. Despite clinical\ncontraindications to lumbar puncture in this patient (sei-\nzures and altered conscious level), the risk of causing harm\nby doing an LP is low. LP should not be delayed by attempts\nto obtain cerebral imaging unless obvious signs of a space-\noccupying lesion are present. CT scan of the brain is of lim-\nited value in bacterial meningitis. Administration of antibi-\notics should not be delayed while the LP is undertaken,\nparticularly in resource-limited settings.\n\nThe main differential diagnoses for this patient are cryp-\ntococcal meningitis (CCM) and TB meningitis (TBM).\nHowever, her CD4 count is too high for CCM and her\nrecent completion of TB treatment makes TBM less likely.\nIn addition, both of these infections classically have a more\nchronic course.\n\nShe is not pregnant, therefore meningitis caused by Lis-\nteria monocytogenes is very unlikely. Bacterial pathogens that\ncause meningitis in HIV-infected adults include S. pneumo-\nniae, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, invasive\nnon-typhoidal salmonellae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli\nand. Haemophilus influenzae; all will be treated with a third-\ngeneration cephalosporin. European guidelines recommend\n14 days of antibiotics in HIV-infected adults with bacterial\nmeningitis. However, in sub-Saharan Africa often shorter\ncourses are given, determined by the patient’s recovery rate,\nlocal guidelines and availability of antibiotics for long\ncourses. In children with bacterial meningitis in Malawi,\n5 days of ceftriaxone was shown to be non-inferior to ten\ndays, with substantial savings shown, and shorter courses\nare now commonly used.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nIn the emergency department the patient received ceftriax-\none 2g IV, 10 mg of diazepam IV and 600 mg of phenobar-\nbitone IV. Her oxygen saturation improved with\nresuscitation. She received 10 days of IV ceftriaxone and\nrecovered consciousness by day 3. CSF culture grew S. pneu-\nmoniae. Audiometry revealed a minor hearing loss in her\nright ear. No further neurological impairment or seizures\nwere noted; anticonvulsants were weaned by day 3.\n\nALY) G\n\nAcute Bacterial Meningitis\n\nIn resource-rich settings, acute bacterial meningitis in adults and\nchildren is declining in incidence because of successful\nvaccination campaigns, but sporadic cases continue to occur.\nIn contrast, many countries with high HIV prevalence have\nreported an increase in patients presenting with acute bacterial\nmeningitis (ABM) since the start of the HIV epidemic.\n\nCase fatality rates in resource-rich settings have declined from\n45-50% to 11-25% over the past 50 years, associated with early\nadministration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and better sup-\nportive care.

It is transmitted by biting Simulium species\n\nblackflies, which breed in rapidly flowing freshwater. Adult\n\nfemales of O. volvulus lodge in human subcutaneous tissue and\n\nshed live microfilariae. Microfilariae migrate through the skin and\n\noften into the eyes. Most pathology is caused by immune reac-\n\ntions to dead and dying microfilariae and perhaps to their endo-\n\nsymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. Typical clinical features of\n\nonchocerciasis are:\n\n1. Non-tender subcutaneous nodules located mainly over bony\nprominences\n\n2. Dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin (‘leopard skin’),\nlichenification and thickening of the skin (‘lizard skin’), and\nskin atrophy at times leading to ‘hanging groins’. The skin\nchanges may be stigmatizing and the unrelenting itch may\ncause sleep disturbances, depression and even lead to\nsuicide\n\n3. Ocular changes may present as pear-shaped pupil, punc-\ntate subepithelial stromal keratopathy, sclerosing keratitis,\niritis, uveitis, ‘flecked retina’ or scarred choroidoretinal fun-\ndus (Hissette-Ridley fundus). Optic nerve atrophy\n\nmay occur.\n\nIvermectin is now the drug of choice for individual and mass\ntreatment of onchocerciasis. Ivermectin kills microfilariae but has\nlittle effect on adult worms apart from reducing embryogenesis. It\nhas to be given repeatedly throughout the lifespan of the adult\nworm (10-14 years). For individual treatment, ivermectin is pro-\nvided as a single dose of 150 j1g/kg PO. Treatment should be\nrepeated in 3- to 6-month intervals. In mass treatment pro-\ngrammes it is usually provided annually. Ivermectin should not be\ngiven to patients with heavy Loa loa infections and microfilarial\ncounts greater than 30,000/mL, because this may result in fatal\nencephalitis. lvermectin can also cause significant adverse events\nin patients with lower microfilarial counts. For regions co-endemic\nof onchocerciasis and L. loa, a mobile phone-based, point-of-\ncare microscopy tool — the LoaScope — has proven helpful to\neasily identify patients with high parasitaemia of L. loa and to\nexempt them from mass treatment with ivermectin. This tech-\nnology has increased the acceptance of ivermectin MDA for\nonchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in L. loa co-endemic areas.\n\nIvermectin is contraindicated in pregnancy and in children\nbelow the age of five or below a height of 90cm.\n\nDoxycycline at a dosage of 100 to 200 mg/d for 4 to 6 weeks\nkills the Wolbachia endosymbionts, permanently sterilizes adult\nworms, blocks embryogenesis and slowly kills approximately\n60% of adult worms.\n\nA major breakthrough in the battle against onchocerciasis was\nthe ivermectin-donation programme initiated by the producing\ncompany Merck.

This is particularly relevant because, in\nendemic areas, cutaneous leishmaniasis often affects\nchildren.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nCutaneous Leishmaniasis\n\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by protozoa of the genus\nLeishmania. Some 20 Leishmania species are associated with\nhuman disease. CL can be anthroponotic or zoonotic (reservoir:\nsmall mammals). The parasite is transmitted by sand flies of the\ngenus Lutzomyia (New World) and Phlebotomus (Old World). Of\nthe estimated 1.5 million annual cases, 90% occur in Afghanistan,\nPakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia and\nPeru.\n\nThe incubation period between sand fly bite and appearance\nof skin lesions ranges from weeks to months. Clinical manifes-\ntations depend on characteristics of the parasite and the host\nimmune response. Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most\ncommon form. Some species of the Leishmania Viannia-complex\ncan produce mucosal lesions resulting in disfiguring disease.\n\nThe lesions can heal spontaneously; this is more common in\nOld World (>50%) than in New World leishmaniasis (<20%). The\naim of treatment is to accelerate healing, reduce scarring and\ndecrease the risk of metastasis and recurrence. Topical therapy is\nrecommended for Old World CL and for New World CL caused by\nspecies not belonging to the Leishmania Viannia-complex. This\ntopical approach consists of intralesional pentavalent antimony,\nPparomomycin cream and/or cryo- or thermotherapy. Systemic\ntherapy is indicated for CL caused by species of the Leishmania\n(Viannia)-complex, which may lead to disfiguring mucocutaneous\nleishmaniasis. In addition, systemic treatment should be given\nwhen lesions are extensive or when topical treatment fails.

Therefore the most important, though overall rare,\ndiagnosis to consider was cutaneous anthrax.\n\nThere may be few distinguishing features at the time of\npresentation, depending on the age of the lesion. Although\nit is commonly known that cutaneous anthrax is manifested\nby a central black eschar, this is not seen until approximately\na week after inoculation. The anthrax lesion begins as a pain-\nless papule that lasts 1 to 2 days before becoming a vesicle\nthat later ruptures. It then develops the classic necrotic cen-\ntral ulcer and may be surrounded by smaller peripheral ves-\nicles. Therefore a patient may present with a non-specific\nlocalized papulovesicular eruption. Key associated findings\ninclude a preceding history of a break in the skin at the\naffected site, the presence of systemic symptoms such as mal-\naise and headache and extensive, non-tender oedema. Fever\nand leukocytosis may not be present. In parts of the world\nwhere anthrax is endemic, zoonotic exposure to infected ani-\nmals or contaminated animal products is important to estab-\nlish, whereas exposure from a bioterrorism act may not be\nimmediately apparent.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Investigations Need to be Performed to\nEstablish Early Diagnosis and Appropriate\nTreatment?\n\nAspirate of fluid from the skin lesion should be sent for Gram\nstain, culture and susceptibilities along with blood cultures in\npatients with systemic symptoms regardless of fever status. In\nthe absence of preceding antimicrobial therapy, numerous\nGram-positive rods in high concentration will grow within\n24 hours. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone\nor doxycycline should be instituted while awaiting microbi-\nological results. Because negative cultures do not exclude\nanthrax, full-thickness punch biopsy from the vesicle and\nthe eschar should be obtained, fixed in 10% buffered forma-\nlin and sent to a specialized laboratory for nucleic acid ampli-\nfication and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to detect\nBacillus anthracis antigens. Serum should also be tested for\nantibodies to the protective antigen at baseline and\n4 weeks later.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nBlood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-\npositive rods. Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion\nobtained at the second visit were negative for B. anthracis.\nThe patient was admitted and received intravenous levoflox-\nacin and ampicillin-sulbactam and recovered. Stains for\nbacteria and IHC of the skin biopsy performed at a reference\nlaboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis and the\npresence of B. anthracis antigens, respectively. Serology\nrevealed that antibody to protective antigen was present in\nconvalescent serum.\n\nThe patient was exposed during his occupation as a postal\nworker, handling contaminated mail. Overall, 22 cases were\nidentified, of which 11 presented with cutaneous anthrax,\nand a further 11 fell ill with the inhalational form. Five peo-\nple died; all deaths occurred secondary to inhalational\nanthrax.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nAnthrax\n\nAnthrax is caused by B. anthracis, a Gram-positive rod that forms\nspores under certain environmental conditions. It is primarily a\nzoonotic disease affecting domestic and wild herbivores. Anthrax\nremains endemic in animals worldwide, most importantly in Asia,\nAfrica and South-eastern Australia, as well as parts of the\nsouthern and western United States. Humans usually acquire the\ninfection when they are exposed to infected animals or animal\nproducts, but anthrax has also been used as an agent of\nbioterrorism. In the developed world, cases usually tend to be\nsporadic. In resource-limited countries anthrax remains a relevant\npublic health problem and large outbreaks can\n\noccasionally occur.\n\nDepending on the route of entry, B. anthracis can cause\ncutaneous, gastrointestinal or inhalational disease. Cutaneous\nanthrax is the most common form worldwide, accounting for 95%\nof all human cases. Although only a small percentage develop\nsystemic disease, it can be lethal if not treated quickly.\n\nThe clinical marker lesion is a painless central ulcer with ves-\nicles and extensive surrounding oedema, but the initial lesion will\nappear as a non-specific papulovesicular eruption.\n\nHistory includes recent exposure to infected animals or con-\ntaminated animal products, unless the setting is a bioterrorism\nevent, a previous break in the skin at the affected site and the\npresence of systemic symptoms in disseminated disease. A high\nindex of suspicion is critical to the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis\nof cutaneous anthrax depends on the setting and the individual\nexposures; it includes bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases,\nrat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia\nand bubonic plague.\n\nGram stain and culture of affected fluids (blood, skin lesion\naspirate, pleural fluid) and paired serological testing for antibodies\nto protective antigen remain the cornerstone of diagnosis.\nHowever, negative cultures do not exclude anthrax. In cutaneous\nanthrax, full-thickness punch biopsy from the vesicle and eschar\nshould be fixed and sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR and\nimmunohistochemical staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment\nwith a quinolone or doxycycline should be instituted while\nawaiting results for limited cutaneous infection.

The fact\nthat the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a\n\n \n\n58\n\n \n\nreason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in\nmalaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at\npresentation. A common misdiagnosis is acute viral hepatitis;\nthere, fever precedes the jaundice, and this rapid fulminant\ncourse would not be typical.

Routine laboratory tests\nare normal, except for a very slightly elevated CRP, his\nCD4-count is low.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Further Investigations Would You Perform to\nConfirm the Diagnosis?\n\nPneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) should be high up in the dif-\nferential of any ART-naive, HIV-positive patient with a low\nCD4 count, who presents with progressive shortness of\nbreath on exertion and dry cough, with patchy perihilar infil-\ntrates on the chest radiograph. Tuberculosis, atypical bacte-\nrial pneumonia, cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis should also\nbe considered. Serum 1,3 B-D-glucan (B-glucan) is fre-\nquently elevated in patients with PCP. Although the p-\nglucan assay has a high sensitivity for PCP, the specificity\nof an elevated B-glucan for PCP diagnosis is low because\nother fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, some drugs\nincluding amoxicillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam,\nand cellulose membranes used for haemodialysis can elevate\nB-glucan levels. Bronchoscopy and immunofluorescence or\nGrocott methenamine silver staining of bronchoalveolar\nlavage (BAL) specimens are the diagnostic tests of choice.\nZichl—Neelsen staining of the BAL fluid for acid-fast bacilli\n(AFB) should also be requested.

CD4 count should be requested as well.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat is Your Immediate Management of the\nPatient?\n\nCorrection of hypoxia aiming for oxygen saturation greater\nthan 95% is top priority. Some patients will require CPAP\nor ventilatory support in addition to oxygen therapy.\nHigh-dose co-trimoxazole is first-line treatment for PCP;\nthis may be given IV in severe respiratory failure or if the\npatient is unable to tolerate oral therapy.

His tachycardia settled with reversal\nof his hypoxia and he remained otherwise stable. In view of his\nmultiple recent long-haul flights a computed tomography\n(CT)-pulmonary angiogram was performed to rule out pul-\nmonary embolism (Fig. 23.2).

Complications include\nrespiratory failure and pneumothorax. Without treatment, PCP is\nprogressive and usually fatal.\n\nGrading of severity at presentation guides management\ndecisions (Table 23.2). Diagnosis is by visualizing P. jirovecii on\nBAL fluid (>90% sensitivity, and sensitivity maintained up to\n10 days into treatment). Induced sputum has lower sensitivity\n(50-90%). PCR of respiratory secretions cannot reliably distin-\nguish infection from colonization. Chest imaging can support the\ndiagnosis, but changes are non-specific and the chest radiograph\nmay be normal. The classic finding is of diffuse perihilar interstitial\ninfiltrates. High-resolution CT scan may show diffuse or patchy\n“ground-glass” infiltrates. A normal CT scan has a high negative\npredictive value for PCP.\n\n \n\n \n\nFirst-line treatment is with co-trimoxazole, which in severe\ncases should initially be intravenous. The addition of high-dose\ncorticosteroids in moderate to severe PCP improves outcomes if\nstarted within 72 hours of starting specific PCP treatment. In HIV-\npositive patients co-trimoxazole should be continued for a total of\n21 days; in other types of immunosuppression 14 days may be\nsufficient. Steroids are weaned over 20 days. ART should be\nstarted within the first 14 days of PCP treatment in ART-naive,\nHIV-positive patients.\n\nIn resource-limited settings, the diagnosis of PCP is most\ncommonly made on clinical grounds. Differentiating PCP from\npulmonary TB is often challenging, and dual infections with both\nTB and PCP also need to be considered. In the absence of\nintensive care options severely ill patients may have to be\nempirically treated for both infections. Co-trimoxazole is often\navailable as an oral formulation only.\n\nAdverse effects with co-trimoxazole are common and usually\noccur at 6 to 14 days of treatment, e.g. cytopaenias (40%), rash\n(25%), fever (20%) and abnormal liver profile (10%). Second-line\ntreatment is with primaquine and clindamycin or IV pentamidine.\nFor mild-to-moderate cases, dapsone-trimethoprim or atova-\nquone may be given.\n\nIn resource-limited settings alternative treatments are\nmostly unavailable. In case of a mild rash, the only option\nmay be desensitization with cautious re-exposure to co-\ntrimoxazole.\n\nSecondary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (480mg or\n960mg od) should be given until a CD4 count over 200/pL\nhas been maintained for at least 3 months after\ncommencing ART.\n\nIn some resource-limited tropical countries, co-trimoxazole is\ncontinued life-long.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.

Konzo is a distinct form of tropical spastic parapar-\nesis which occurs exclusively in cassava-growing areas in\n\nAfrica.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Do You Plan to Manage this Patient?\n\nThere is no cure for patients with konzo because it results in a\npermanent spastic paraparesis. Management is therefore\ndirected at support, symptomatic improvement and disease\nprevention. The majority of patients can walk with the aid\nof a stick or crutches and some will benefit from a wheelchair.\nMuscle relaxants have a limited role because of relative inef-\nfectiveness as a result of the severity of the spasticity, and\n\nthese agents’ high long-term cost.

The word\n“konzo” means “tied legs” in the language of the Yaka tribe in the\nDRC. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of a permanent but\nnon-progressive form of spastic paraparesis related to cassava\nconsumption. It occurs mainly as epidemics, typically during\ndroughts, famines or armed conflict when there is an overreliance\non cassava as a staple food for weeks or months. It also occurs in\nan endemic form but at much lower rates. It affects mainly children\nand breastfeeding mothers.\nThe following are the clinical criteria for diagnosing konzo:\n¢ symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or geni-\ntourinary involvement\n¢ abrupt onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive\ncourse\n\n¢ occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other\ncases emerging at the same time\n\n¢ no other cause found\n\nIts cause is attributed to chronic high dietary exposure of\ncyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava\ntubers, but the exact pathogenic mechanisms of konzo remain\nunknown.\n\nCassava is a staple food for more than 600 million people. It\ngrows well in poor soils and is resistant to drought, plant diseases,\ninsects and animal predators, but it contains cyanogenic glyco-\nsides, mainly linamarin. Processing disrupts the tubers releasing\ncyanide, which makes the food safe for human consumption.\nKonzo is associated with high intake of insufficiently processed\ncassava tubers in combination with low or absent levels of the\nessential amino acids methionine or cysteine.

Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solu-\ntion made the fungal cells more readily visible. Antifungal\ntreatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for\n7 days monthly pulse therapy) and surgical debridement\nof all lesions performed. PCR from skin tissue was positive\n\n \n\n° Fig. 25.2 Characteristic brownish sclerotic cells in skin scrapings\n(100 x, oil immersion, wet film).\n\nand sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea ped-\nrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. When oral terbinafine\ncould be obtained this was added (initially 500 mg/d, later\n750mg/d) for 9 months and local terbinafine ointment\nwas applied for 6 months. Liver function tests and serum glu-\ncose were monitored during treatment and remained nor-\nmal. The lesions healed uneventfully with some residual\nswelling and hypopigmentation.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nChromoblastomycosis\n\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and\nsubcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet and\n\nlower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous\ninoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora and\nCladophialophora which are found in plant debris or forest\ndetritus. Infection occurs worldwide but is most common in rural\ntropical and subtropical areas. Male agricultural workers are most\ncommonly affected.\n\nPainless lesions develop slowly over years from the site of\ninoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading\ncentripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. Typical\ncomplications are ulcerations, bacterial superinfection and\nchronic lymphoedema, which may be confused with elephanti-\nasis in regions co-endemic with lymphatic filariasis.\n\nDiagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of\npathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings (‘Medlar bodies’,\nfumagoid or muriform cells). These are brownish, round, thick-\nwalled structures of 4 to 12 jm length, which are already visible\non a simple wet film. Hyphae can be more readily seen on a\npotassium hydroxide preparation. More sophisticated techniques\nsuch as culture as well as serology and PCR are rarely available in\nendemic areas and are often reserved for research purposes; but\nspecies identification can also guide treatment schemes.\n\nTreatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the\ncausative agent, the clinical form and the severity of the lesions.\nAntifungal therapy commonly comprises oral itraconazole\n\n \n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "(-}: GV NCME=isawsom A 72-Year-Old Male Farmer from Laos With Extensive Skin Lesions on the Lower Leg\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat Are the Important Differential Diagnoses?\n\nChronic verrucous skin lesions can typically be seen in\nfungal infections such as sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenckii)\nand chromoblastomycosis, which is caused by various\npigmented fungi.

Use of 10% potassium hydroxide solu-\ntion made the fungal cells more readily visible. Antifungal\ntreatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for\n7 days monthly pulse therapy) and surgical debridement\nof all lesions performed. PCR from skin tissue was positive\n\n \n\n° Fig. 25.2 Characteristic brownish sclerotic cells in skin scrapings\n(100 x, oil immersion, wet film).\n\nand sequencing revealed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea ped-\nrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. When oral terbinafine\ncould be obtained this was added (initially 500 mg/d, later\n750mg/d) for 9 months and local terbinafine ointment\nwas applied for 6 months. Liver function tests and serum glu-\ncose were monitored during treatment and remained nor-\nmal. The lesions healed uneventfully with some residual\nswelling and hypopigmentation.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nChromoblastomycosis\n\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and\nsubcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet and\n\nlower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous\ninoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora and\nCladophialophora which are found in plant debris or forest\ndetritus. Infection occurs worldwide but is most common in rural\ntropical and subtropical areas. Male agricultural workers are most\ncommonly affected.\n\nPainless lesions develop slowly over years from the site of\ninoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading\ncentripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. Typical\ncomplications are ulcerations, bacterial superinfection and\nchronic lymphoedema, which may be confused with elephanti-\nasis in regions co-endemic with lymphatic filariasis.\n\nDiagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of\npathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings (‘Medlar bodies’,\nfumagoid or muriform cells). These are brownish, round, thick-\nwalled structures of 4 to 12 jm length, which are already visible\non a simple wet film. Hyphae can be more readily seen on a\npotassium hydroxide preparation. More sophisticated techniques\nsuch as culture as well as serology and PCR are rarely available in\nendemic areas and are often reserved for research purposes; but\nspecies identification can also guide treatment schemes.\n\nTreatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the\ncausative agent, the clinical form and the severity of the lesions.\nAntifungal therapy commonly comprises oral itraconazole"}}

Puff-adders are about one\nmetre long and stout. They show a distinctive “V or ‘U’ pat-\ntern on their back. When disturbed, they behave aggres-\nsively, hissing loudly and inflating their body. The puff-\nadder is a highly dangerous snake, with large quantities of\na potent venom and long fangs. It commonly lives in densely\npopulated areas. Throughout the African savannah, this spe-\ncies is responsible for a large number of serious bites. The\nmain problem is massive local swelling, which may spread\nto involve the whole limb and cause hypovolaemic shock.\nBullae filled with haemorrhagic fluid may develop at the site\nof the bite. Extensive necrosis may occur. Cardiotoxic effects\nof the venom may lead to arrhythmias, and the venom may\ncause systemic haemorrhage.\n\nThe puff-adder, along with the saw-scaled or carpet viper\n(Echis species), which produces similar symptoms, are\nresponsible for most fatalities after snake bites in Africa. In\ncontrast, bites by mambas, the most feared snakes in Africa,\nare relatively uncommon.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWhat First-Aid Measures Should Have Been Taken?\n\nFirst-aid should include reassurance of the victim. Paraceta-\nmol should be used for pain relief because aspirin might\naggravate haemorrhage and morphine can enhance respira-\ntory depression caused by the venom. Any tight jewellery\nshould be removed. The affected limb should be immobi-\nlized along with the whole patient, because any muscular\ncontractions will increase the absorption of the venom.\n\nIf a neurotoxic venom cannot be excluded, a pressure\nimmobilization technique should be used; e.g. a long elas-\ntic bandage can be wrapped around the affected limb\nincorporating a splint. However, in cytotoxic venoms\nthe local effects may be worsened through such pressure\ntechniques.\n\nThe wound itself should be left alone to avoid infection\nand absorption of the venom.\n\nThe patient should gently but quickly be taken to the\nnearest appropriate health facility. Patients should be placed\nin a recovery position if vomiting or if their level of con-\nsciousness is reduced. All patients bitten by snakes should\nideally be observed in hospital for at least 24 hours.\n\nFinally, helpers should not try to kill the snake, risking\nfurther bites. However, if the snake has already been killed\n\n \n\nit should be taken to the healthcare facility for identification.\nEven a dead snake needs to be handled with great caution as\nit still may bite by reflex. Smart-phone photography of the\nculprit snake is another alternative.\n\nSome widely popular first-aid measures have never been\nproven to be of any help in the management of snake bites;\nthese include local cuts with a knife or razor blade,\nattempts to suck the venom out of the wound, the often\ndisastrous application of an arterial tourniquet, cauteriza-\ntion, chemicals, ice, electric shocks and the use of ‘magic\nstones’.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe snake bite had occurred 3 weeks earlier, therefore appli-\ncation of antivenom was not deemed useful. Because the boy\nwas septic upon admission, he was managed according to the\ninternational sepsis treatment guidelines, crucially including\nearly start of broad-spectrum antibiotics, ‘ventilatory sup-\nport’ and fluid resuscitation.

GV N=ME=i-aewa A 16-Year-Old Boy from Sri Lanka With Fever, Jaundice and Renal Failure\n\nDiscussion\n\n \n\nA Sri Lankan teenage boy presents with fever, severe body\naches and a reduced urine output. He is jaundiced with sub-\nconjunctival haemorrhage and has a tender hepatomegaly.\nHe has had contact with a water stream before his ill health.\n\nHis laboratory results show signs of cholestasis with only\nmildly elevated transaminases. The creatinine is increased\ntwofold and there is thrombocytopenia. The leucocyte count\nis normal.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What Are\nYour Differentials?\n\nAn acute febrile illness accompanied by jaundice, renal fail-\nure and subconjunctival haemorrhage should raise the suspi-\ncion of leptospirosis, particularly in case of a history\ninvolving exposure to potentially contaminated water.\n\nScrub typhus is another very common infection in South\nAsia. It may present with an acute onset of fever, hepatomeg-\naly and renal failure. There usually is lymphadenopathy;\nand on careful examination, one may spot an eschar.\nSubconjunctival haemorrhage has been described but is less\ncommon than in leptospirosis, and complications such as\nrenal failure tend to occur late in the infection (after about\n7 days).\n\nHantavirus infection may cause a haemorrhagic fever with\nrenal syndrome. It has a similar epidemiology to leptospirosis\nand is also associated with contact with rodent excreta.\n\nDengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is another differential\ndiagnosis to consider. It also presents with fever, severe myal-\ngias, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhages. Acute kidney\ninjury and jaundice are uncommon for DHF.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Tests Are Indicated to Confirm the\nDiagnosis?\n\nThe microscopic diagnosis of leptospirosis requires a dark-\nfield or a phase-contrast microscope because the bacteria\nstain poorly. However, dark-field microscopy is of poor sen-\nsitivity and specificity and only yields positive results during\nthe early bacteraemic phase of the disease.\n\nLeptospira may be cultured from blood, CSF or urine. Iso-\nlation of the bacteria from blood or CSF is only possible dur-\ning the first week of illness. Samples have to be incubated for\nat least 8 weeks and analysed weekly with a dark-field micro-\nscope. This technique is laborious and not routine practice in\na standard microbiological laboratory.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection has been used\non blood, CSF and urine. PCR performance varies between\ntypes of samples taken and depends on the time the sample\nwas taken in relation to duration of illness. Sensitivity and\nspecificity appear to be higher in urine than in blood and\nare better in blood samples taken early rather than later dur-\ning the course of illness.\n\nFor indirect diagnosis, the historical reference serological\ntest is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). MAT relies\non incubation of patient serum with Leptospira antigen sus-\npension and determines agglutination with a dark-field\nmicroscope. This method requires a high level of expertise\nand is limited to expert centres.\n\nThe MAT cannot differentiate between current or past\ninfections. Therefore two consecutive serum samples should\nbe examined to look for seroconversion or at least a fourfold\nrise in titre. The significance of titres in single serum speci-\nmens is a matter of debate.\n\nVarious ELISA tests detecting anti-Leptospira IgM are\nnow commercially available, facilitating the diagnosis outside\nreference centres. It appears that sensitivity of these tests is\nhighly variable if blood is examined during week one of\nthe illness, it improves (75% and 100%) if blood is taken\nafter day 7. A positive IgM ELISA should be confirmed\nby MAT.\n\n \n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nSevere leptospirosis was suspected and the patient was com-\nmenced on empirical benzylpenicillin. Despite rehydration\nhe developed acute renal failure warranting haemodialysis\n(HD). He developed myocarditis and atrial fibrillation,\nbut luckily tolerated further HD. He gradually recovered\nover 10 days with intensive care management.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nLeptospirosis\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs worldwide. It is\ncaused by pathogenic Leptospira species, which belong to the\nspirochaetes. The most common species causing disease in\nhumans and animals are L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii.\n\nHumans become infected through direct contact with urine of\ninfected mammalian hosts, contact with contaminated water or\nanimal abortion products. The major reservoirs are rodents,\ncanines, livestock and wild mammals. Most at risk are slum\ndwellers and people with an occupational or recreational\nexposure involving animal contact or immersion in water. Also,\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes and floods may put people\nat risk.\n\nThe bacteria enter the human body through cuts or abrasions\nof the skin or through intact mucous membranes. The incubation\nperiod is 2 to 30 days. The spectrum of disease ranges from\nasymptomatic to severe infection.\n\nThe classical presentation of leptospirosis is that of a biphasic\nillness. The initial leptospiraemic phase usually starts abruptly.\nSymptoms are non-specific with fever, headache, sore throat,\nabdominal pain and a rash. Severe myalgias, most notably of the\ncalves and the lumbar area, and subconjunctival haemorrhage\nhave been mentioned as distinguishing physical findings. This first\nphase lasts for a week and is followed by a second phase\ndominated by immune-mediated pathology.\n\nFive to ten per cent of those with clinical infection will develop\nsevere leptospirosis with cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury\nand haemorrhagic diathesis (Weil’s syndrome).

The reason for this is unclear.\n\nSevere anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progres-\nsive ‘weakness’ in this patient. It is most likely a consequence\nof infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and\npossibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nOther causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency,\nhelminth infections and malaria, are less common in an\nHIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be\nconsidered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant\nwomen or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a\nmicrocytic anaemia.\n\nSevere anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa.\nPatients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at\ntimes only when they are developing heart failure secondary\nto severe anaemia.\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancyto-\npenia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatos-\nplenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears\nnot to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in\nother parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda\nand Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\n\nFluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started\nimmediately. Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cul-\ntures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is\nimportant to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20—\n40ml) for culture.\n\nSevere anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a\nsign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for\nunderlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdom-\ninal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is\n<100 cells/pl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan\n(LAM) may also help confirm TB.\n\nOf note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient\nwith TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine\ninvestigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on\nthe list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a\nsatisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or\ncontinues to lose weight.\n\nThe baseline CD4 count should be checked and the patient\nshould be started on co-trimoxazole preventive treatment as\nprophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis\nand other opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) should be started as soon as possible, once the acute\ninfection is under control and concomitant opportunistic\ninfections have been ruled out. The latter is important to pre-\nvent unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syn-\ndrome (IRIS). Her children and her current and past sexual\npartners should be encouraged to go for an HIV test.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nBlood cultures were taken and the patient was started on IV\nceftriaxone 2 g od, as well as on fluid resuscitation. Blood\ncultures grew Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium. Her\n\nantibiotic treatment was changed to oral ciprofloxacin\n500 mg tds which was continued for 14 days. TB screening\nrevealed prominent hilar lymph nodes and the patient was\nalso commenced on antituberculous treatment and on anti-\nretroviral therapy. She also received co-trimoxazole prophy-\naxis, vitamin Bg to prevent peripheral neuropathy and\ntherapeutic feeding.\n\nShe was discharged after 4 weeks in hospital. On review in\nART clinic 3 months later she was feeling much better. She\nhad gained weight and her haemoglobin levels were picking\nup. Her three children tested negative for HIV. Her ex-\nhusband refused to go for HIV-testing.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nInvasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) Infection\n\nS. enterica is a leading cause of community-acquired\nbloodstream infection in Africa and Asia. Typhoidal Salmonella\nspecies cause typhoid and paratyphoid, i.e. enteric fever. They\nare restricted to human hosts. Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are\nhost generalists, colonizing and infecting a broad range of\nvertebrate animals.\n\nNon-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) usually cause a self-limiting\nenterocolitis in immunocompetent individuals. In contrast, in sub-\nSaharan Africa (SSA) NTS commonly cause invasive disease\nresulting in sepsis and death. Important populations at risk for\ndevelopment of iNTS infection are infants and children living in\nareas of high transmission intensity for falciparum malaria and/or\nwith severe malnutrition, and adults with advanced HIV-infection.\n\nIn Asia, enteric fever still prevails as a cause of invasive\nsalmonellosis, which may be associated with the lower\nprevalence of iNTS risk factors in the population.\n\nBoth the reservoir and source of infection for INTS remain\nunclear. S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the most common\nserovars, but it is unknown if the same strains cause invasive and\ndiarrhoeal disease and if the modes of transmission are the same.\n\nInfection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific\nfebrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history\nof diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild\nsplenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients,\nhepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with\niNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection,\nwith pathogens such as MM. tuberculosis or Streptococcus\npneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the\nclinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\n\nBlood culture remains the diagnostic standard; however, it is\nnot widely available in many African settings. Also, sensitivity\nof blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude\nof bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL).

The reason for this is unclear.\n\nSevere anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progres-\nsive ‘weakness’ in this patient. It is most likely a consequence\nof infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and\npossibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nOther causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency,\nhelminth infections and malaria, are less common in an\nHIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be\nconsidered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant\nwomen or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a\nmicrocytic anaemia.\n\nSevere anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa.\nPatients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at\ntimes only when they are developing heart failure secondary\nto severe anaemia.\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancyto-\npenia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatos-\nplenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears\nnot to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in\nother parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda\nand Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\n\nFluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started\nimmediately. Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cul-\ntures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is\nimportant to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20—\n40ml) for culture.\n\nSevere anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a\nsign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for\nunderlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdom-\ninal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is\n<100 cells/pl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan\n(LAM) may also help confirm TB.\n\nOf note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient\nwith TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine\ninvestigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on\nthe list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a\nsatisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or\ncontinues to lose weight.\n\nThe baseline CD4 count should be checked and the patient\nshould be started on co-trimoxazole preventive treatment as\nprophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis\nand other opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) should be started as soon as possible, once the acute\ninfection is under control and concomitant opportunistic\ninfections have been ruled out. The latter is important to pre-\nvent unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syn-\ndrome (IRIS). Her children and her current and past sexual\npartners should be encouraged to go for an HIV test.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nBlood cultures were taken and the patient was started on IV\nceftriaxone 2 g od, as well as on fluid resuscitation. Blood\ncultures grew Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium. Her\n\nantibiotic treatment was changed to oral ciprofloxacin\n500 mg tds which was continued for 14 days. TB screening\nrevealed prominent hilar lymph nodes and the patient was\nalso commenced on antituberculous treatment and on anti-\nretroviral therapy. She also received co-trimoxazole prophy-\naxis, vitamin Bg to prevent peripheral neuropathy and\ntherapeutic feeding.\n\nShe was discharged after 4 weeks in hospital. On review in\nART clinic 3 months later she was feeling much better. She\nhad gained weight and her haemoglobin levels were picking\nup. Her three children tested negative for HIV. Her ex-\nhusband refused to go for HIV-testing.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nInvasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) Infection\n\nS. enterica is a leading cause of community-acquired\nbloodstream infection in Africa and Asia. Typhoidal Salmonella\nspecies cause typhoid and paratyphoid, i.e. enteric fever. They\nare restricted to human hosts. Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are\nhost generalists, colonizing and infecting a broad range of\nvertebrate animals.\n\nNon-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) usually cause a self-limiting\nenterocolitis in immunocompetent individuals. In contrast, in sub-\nSaharan Africa (SSA) NTS commonly cause invasive disease\nresulting in sepsis and death. Important populations at risk for\ndevelopment of iNTS infection are infants and children living in\nareas of high transmission intensity for falciparum malaria and/or\nwith severe malnutrition, and adults with advanced HIV-infection.\n\nIn Asia, enteric fever still prevails as a cause of invasive\nsalmonellosis, which may be associated with the lower\nprevalence of iNTS risk factors in the population.\n\nBoth the reservoir and source of infection for INTS remain\nunclear. S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the most common\nserovars, but it is unknown if the same strains cause invasive and\ndiarrhoeal disease and if the modes of transmission are the same.\n\nInfection with iNTS commonly presents as a non-specific\nfebrile illness. Some patients report abdominal pain or a history\nof diarrhoea, but often the focus remains clinically unclear. Mild\nsplenomegaly occurs in more than one-third of patients,\nhepatomegaly is less common. About 30% of patients with\niNTS have a concomitant lower respiratory tract co-infection,\nwith pathogens such as MM. tuberculosis or Streptococcus\npneumoniae. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the\nclinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\n\nBlood culture remains the diagnostic standard; however, it is\nnot widely available in many African settings. Also, sensitivity\nof blood culture is suboptimal because of the low magnitude\nof bacteraemia (median <1 CFU/mL). Care should therefore be\ntaken to inoculate large enough volumes of blood for culture.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance among iNTS strains in Africa is\nincreasing. Empirical management is similar to enteric fever and\nincludes either a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, depending on\nthe local resistance pattern and drug availability. If oral intake is\nnot possible, a third-generation cephalosporin should be\nadministered. Effective antibiotic treatment should be given for\n10 to 14 days. Antiretroviral therapy should be started urgently\nto prevent relapse. The case fatality rate of patients with INTS\nis much higher than in enteric fever (22-47% vs 1%).", "Further Reading": "1.

It is crucial to maintain a high index of\nsuspicion in settings with high TB prevalence (Table 3.4). The\nWHO now recommends the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra as the\ninitial diagnostic test for suspected tuberculous meningitis. The\nXpert is a cartridge-based fully automated PCR test that can\neasily be used, even in resource-limited settings.\n\nTB-meningitis is an emergency. Treatment should be started\nwithout delay once the diagnosis is considered. The WHO\nrecommends treatment with the same regimen as any form of\ntuberculosis starting with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol\nand pyrazinamide. Usually, treatment is for 9 to 12 months.\nCorticosteroids seem to improve clinical outcomes and are cur-\nrently recommended; however, their effects may vary in different\nclinical settings.\n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.

Vasculitis is the most serious com-\nplication of tuberculous meningitis and may lead to cerebrovas-\ncular accidents.\n\nA definitive diagnosis of TB-meningitis is established when\nacid-fast bacilli are seen in the CSF or detected by a reliable\nmolecular method such as PCR, or if Mycobacterium tuberculosis\nis cultured from the CSF. It is crucial to maintain a high index of\nsuspicion in settings with high TB prevalence (Table 3.4). The\nWHO now recommends the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra as the\ninitial diagnostic test for suspected tuberculous meningitis. The\nXpert is a cartridge-based fully automated PCR test that can\neasily be used, even in resource-limited settings.\n\nTB-meningitis is an emergency. Treatment should be started\nwithout delay once the diagnosis is considered. The WHO\nrecommends treatment with the same regimen as any form of\ntuberculosis starting with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol\nand pyrazinamide. Usually, treatment is for 9 to 12 months.\nCorticosteroids seem to improve clinical outcomes and are cur-\nrently recommended; however, their effects may vary in different\nclinical settings.", "Further Reading": "1.

Malaria treatment was stopped as smears\nturned out to be negative. Within the next 3 days, the rash\ncovered the trunk and skin scaling started over the chest\n(Fig. 31.1). The boy developed severe pneumonia and\nreceived antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral\ntherapy was started in the out-patient-clinic.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection, caused by a para-\nmyxovirus and transmitted through droplets. The course of the\ndisease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune\nstatus of the affected individual.\n\nDespite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large\nmeasles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incu-\nbation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage\npresents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed\nafter a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the\nears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs. Severe\ndesquamation of the skin may develop during the course of the\nillness. The patient is highly contagious from about 4 days before\nuntil up to 4 days after the appearance of the exanthema.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals may not show the rash\n(‘white measles’), nevertheless they are highly vulnerable to\ndeveloping complications. Furthermore, a sub-acute ‘inclusion-\nbody’ encephalitis has been described in the\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA 6-Year-Old Boy from Malawi With Fever, Cough and Impaired Consciousness\n\nimmunocompromised, which occurs a few months after the\nacute measles infection.\n\nA late complication after several years is subacute severe\nsclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is invariably fatal. SSPE\nhas an incidence of one in 10 000 to one in a million cases of\nmeasles.\n\nThe Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in well-resourced settings is\naround 0.3 per 1000 whereas worldwide CFRs range between 3\nand 5% and up to 30% in refugee settings. More than 95% of\ndeaths occur in developing countries, mostly in children below the\nage of 5 years old.\n\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment. In developing coun-\ntries, all children with measles should receive vitamin A supple-\nmentation, which prevents blindness and death. Vaccination or\napplication of human immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure\nmay help protect non-vaccinated contacts.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination of children is recommended by\nWHO.

The boy developed severe pneumonia and\nreceived antibiotic treatment. After recovery, antiretroviral\ntherapy was started in the out-patient-clinic.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection, caused by a para-\nmyxovirus and transmitted through droplets. The course of the\ndisease is strongly influenced by both nutritional and immune\nstatus of the affected individual.\n\nDespite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, large\nmeasles outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. After an incu-\nbation period of 8 to 12 days, the non-specific prodromal stage\npresents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and cough, followed\nafter a few days by a maculopapular rash, evolving behind the\nears and in the face, spreading over the trunk and limbs. Severe\ndesquamation of the skin may develop during the course of the\nillness. The patient is highly contagious from about 4 days before\nuntil up to 4 days after the appearance of the exanthema.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals may not show the rash\n(‘white measles’), nevertheless they are highly vulnerable to\ndeveloping complications. Furthermore, a sub-acute ‘inclusion-\nbody’ encephalitis has been described in the\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA 6-Year-Old Boy from Malawi With Fever, Cough and Impaired Consciousness\n\nimmunocompromised, which occurs a few months after the\nacute measles infection.\n\nA late complication after several years is subacute severe\nsclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is invariably fatal. SSPE\nhas an incidence of one in 10 000 to one in a million cases of\nmeasles.\n\nThe Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in well-resourced settings is\naround 0.3 per 1000 whereas worldwide CFRs range between 3\nand 5% and up to 30% in refugee settings. More than 95% of\ndeaths occur in developing countries, mostly in children below the\nage of 5 years old.\n\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment. In developing coun-\ntries, all children with measles should receive vitamin A supple-\nmentation, which prevents blindness and death. Vaccination or\napplication of human immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure\nmay help protect non-vaccinated contacts.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination of children is recommended by\nWHO. Recent adaptations in international vaccination schedules\nare recommending measles vaccination in infants of 9 months of\nage. Almost 100% of children vaccinated with two doses of the\nsafe live measles vaccine will have protective immunity. However,\nsince measles is highly contagious, around 95% of a population\nneed to be vaccinated to preserve herd immunity.\n\nAsymptomatic and not severely immunocompromised chil-\ndren with HIV should receive measles vaccine because the risk of\nsevere measles complications outweighs possible side effects of\nthe vaccine.

He\nis a known type 2 diabetic but has been non-adherent to his\nantidiabetic medication.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\n\nBacterial abscess with sepsis may be caused by Staphylococcus\naureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or other Streptococcus species,\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus or anaerobes. This\npatient, however, has epidemiological and clinical risk factors\nfor melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. This\nmay cause a spectrum of disease in immunocompromised\npatients, especially diabetics, ranging from localized abscesses\nto pneumonia and septicaemia with disseminated abscess\nformation and high mortality. There is often no history of\nan inoculation injury or trauma.\n\nTuberculosis should also be considered with the sub-acute\nhistory of abscess with respiratory findings; however, tuber-\nculous abscesses are usually ‘cold’, without much pain, ery-\nthema or warmth.\n\nDisseminated fungal infection seems unlikely but would\nbe possible if there was additional immunocompromise such\nas HIV.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Additional Investigations Would You Like\nto Do?\n\nEssential investigations include blood culture and abscess\nswab (or deep pus) for microscopy and culture. A throat\nswab, or sputum sample if there is pulmonary involvement,\nmay also be cultured on selective media, such as Ashdown’s\nagar. A chest radiograph (CXR) should be done looking for\nevidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. An ultrasound of\nthe abdomen, or other imaging such as CT or MRI scan,\nshould also be considered, because the findings of liver\nand splenic abscesses would strongly support a diagnosis of\nmelioidosis while culture results are awaited. Biochemistry\nassays to check glucose and creatinine are important to opti-\nmize glycaemic control and adjust drug dosage respectively.\nDepending on the CXR findings, sputum, pleural fluid\nand pus may be sent for staining for acid-fast bacilli (e.g.\nZiehl—Neelsen stain) and M. tuberculosis-PCR (e.g. Xpert\nMTB/RIF).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nPus culture yielded B. pseudomallei after 48 hours, and later\nhis blood culture also grew the same bacterium. Three throat\nswabs were cultured on selective media but failed to grow the\norganism. The CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions\n(Fig. 32.2). A shoulder radiograph showed no evidence of\nbony involvement. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatos-\nplenomegaly without evidence of liver or splenic abscesses.\n\n \n\n¢ Fig. 32.2 Admission chest radiograph of the patient, showing bilateral\npleural effusions.\n\nThe patient was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and\ngentamicin while awaiting the culture results. Treatment was\nswitched to ceftazidime after 48 hours when the laboratory\nalerted the clinicians to the suspicion of melioidosis. The\npatient improved after 7 days of treatment and was afebrile\nby day 14, when he was switched to oral co-trimoxazole to\ncomplete 20 weeks. Glycaemic control was established.\nNo other foci of infection were detected by locally available\ninvestigations. The patient was discharged after 21 days of\nhospitalization and continued on oral ‘eradication’ treatment\nfor 5 months.

The disease is being described with\nincreasing frequency both in non-endemic and in endemic areas.\nThis may be because of a combination of greater awareness,\nimproving laboratory facilities and research and possibly also as a\nresult of a genuine increase in incidence. A modelling study has\nestimated 165,000 human melioidosis cases with 89,000 deaths\nper year worldwide making it a significant neglected tropical\ndisease (NTD), even though it does not feature on the WHO’s list\nof NTDs.\n\nNorth-eastern Thailand and northern Australia are highly\nendemic areas, where B. pseudomallei is an important cause of\ncommunity-acquired sepsis and pneumonia. It is probably widely\ndistributed elsewhere outside the endemic region and may be\ngreatly underdiagnosed.\n\nHumans are thought usually to become infected by percuta-\nneous inoculation through cuts and abrasions (e.g. when working\nin rice fields), inhalation/aspiration during severe weather events\nand ingestion (e.g. ingestion of contaminated and unchlorinated\nwater supplies), although it is often difficult to determine precisely\nthe mode of acquisition.

What is your suspected diagnosis?\n2. How would you approach this patient?\n\nDiscussion\n\n \n\nA 53-year-old Malawian man presents with chronic cough\nand constitutional symptoms. A course of oral antibiotics\ndid not yield any improvement. The patient is not aware\nof any TB contacts. On admission he is newly diagnosed\nwith HIV-infection and advanced immunosuppression.\nHis sputum microscopy is negative for acid-fast bacilli\n(AFB). Chest radiography shows a prominent hilar region\nbut is otherwise normal.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat is Your Suspected Diagnosis?\n\nIn all HIV-positive patients with cough and weight loss who\ndo not respond to antibiotic therapy, tuberculosis is top of\nthe list of differential diagnoses. In this case the most likely\ndiagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary TB.\n\nTB in patients with advanced immunosuppression often\npresents with a clinical picture that is very different from\nimmunocompetent individuals: sputum smear-negative\nTB, which is uncommon in HIV-negative patients, is com-\nmonly seen in HIV-infected patients, particularly if immu-\nnosuppression is advanced as in this case. The slightly\nprominent hilar region seen on the patient's chest radiograph\nis compatible with the intrathoracic lymphadenopathy: typ-\nical though not specific for TB. Physical examination of the\nchest is normal in about half of HIV patients with\npulmonary TB.\n\nThe fact that the patient does not report any TB contact\nshould not be overvalued. Firstly, TB in immunosuppression\nis often a consequence of reactivation and the primary infec-\ntion may have been decades ago. Secondly, in resource-limited\ncountries, practically everyone is exposed to TB — this could\noccur during a ride on an overcrowded minibus or when con-\ngregating with friends and family in someone’s small home.\n\nGiven the fact that our patient is in an advanced stage of\nimmunosuppression and has not taken any co-trimoxazole\nprophylaxis, an alternative or possibly co-existing diagnosis\nto consider is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A\nconcomitant bacterial chest infection is possible but unlikely\nto explain the whole 3 months of illness.\n\nKaposi’s sarcoma (KS) of the lung is another differential\ndiagnosis to consider, but patients with pulmonary KS usu-\nally have manifestations of KS elsewhere (skin, oral mucosa).\nOn chest radiography of patients with pulmonary KS, patchy\ninfiltrations are commonly seen in the lower lung zones. Nei-\nther was the case in our patient, which makes this diagnosis\nunlikely.\n\nPulmonary malignancy or pulmonary sarcoidosis, which\nwould be high on the list of differential diagnoses in indus-\ntrialized countries, are much less likely than an infectious\ncause in the given setting.\n\nApart from chest infections, Gram-negative sepsis second-\nary to invasive non-typhoidal Sa/monellae (iNTS) needs to be\nconsidered in this febrile and anaemic patient with advanced\nimmunosuppression.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Approach This Patient?\n\nInduced sputum should be examined for acid-fast bacilli.\nReal-time PCR-based tests such as XPert MTB/RIF are\neasy to use, more sensitive than microscopy and also help\ndetect rifampicin resistance. Thanks to an endorsement\nby WHO and international donor support, XPert MTB/\nRIF is increasingly available even at remote hospitals in\nrural areas.\n\nMycobacterial cultures of the sputum should be done but\nresults will take several weeks, too long to guide the clini-\ncian’s imminent decision.\n\nIdeally, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should\nbe done and material assessed for MM. tuberculosis (PCR, cul-\nture, microscopy) and Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCR, micros-\ncopy). Pulmonary Kaposi’s sarcoma could also be diagnosed\non endoscopy.\n\nUrine lipoarabinomannan (urine-LAM) is a simple\nlateral-flow assay helpful to look for TB in patients with\nadvanced immunosuppression (CD4 <100/l). A positive\ntest indicates disseminated TB with renal involvement.\n\nUltrasound is also very useful and simple to look for signs\nof extrapulmonary/disseminated TB in patients with\nadvanced immunosuppression. Simple and very useful algo-\nrithms have been published to guide clinicians not\nultrasound-experienced in the diagnosis of TB.\n\nIf none of these investigations is available, it is well justi-\nfiable to empirically start the patient on antituberculous\ntreatment, because sputum smear-negative TB is common\nand fatal if untreated. Adding prednisolone for the first\n4 weeks of antituberculous treatment has been shown to\nreduce the incidence of immune-reconstitution inflamma-\ntory syndrome (IRIS).\n\nAdditional antibiotic treatment should be considered in\nthis febrile patient with advanced immunosuppression. If\navailable, blood cultures should be taken in any febrile\npatient before starting antibiotic treatment. Also, adding\nhigh-dose co-trimoxazole to antituberculous therapy as pre-\nsumptive treatment for PCP has to be considered if the\npatient does not clinically improve. The optimal timing\nto initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) is within the first\n8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within\nthe first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts\n<50 cells/pl.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nInduced sputum results came back negative for AFB and\nthere was no sputum PCR available.

Ninety-five per\ncent of CM cases in developing countries are HIV-associated. CM\nis the most common cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high.\n\nCryptococcal meningitis is caused by the encapsulated\nenvironmental yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. It is an oppor-\ntunistic infection, which occurs at advanced stages of immuno-\nsuppression, in HIV mostly at CD4 counts below 100/pL. Patients\nusually present with a sub-acute headache of several days to\nweeks duration. Other common clinical findings are cranial nerve\npalsies (N VI), confusion and impaired consciousness. Altered\nmental state is associated with increased lethality. CM is clinically\nindistinguishable from tuberculous meningitis (TBM), although\nfever and neck stiffness are more common in TBM.\n\nCSF opening pressure is often markedly elevated. Further\nCSF findings are commonly non-specific, and the CSF may even\nbe normal. Diagnosis of CM is made by demonstrating the fungus\nin the CSF. This is traditionally done by light microscopy after\nIndia-Ink staining (Fig. 35.2), but this method is user-dependent\nand the sensitivity is therefore variable. Detection of CrAg e.g. by\nlatex-agglutination test or lateral flow assay (LFA) is better. Fungal\nculture of CSF is required to isolate the organism for antimicrobial\nsusceptibility testing. CM treatment consists of three phases:\ninduction, consolidation, and maintenance. The gold standard is\nan induction therapy with two fungicidal drugs that rapidly\ndecrease the fungal burden in the CSF i.e. combined (liposomal)\namphotericin B plus flucytosine (IV or oral) for the initial 2 weeks,\nfollowed by oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for at least 8 weeks and\nfluconazole maintenance therapy 200mg daily until immune\nreconstitution.\n\nThe reality in many resource-limited settings is however\nhampered by poor drug availability and therefore commonly dif-\nfers from the gold standard. Oral fluconazole is often the only\navailable drug, thanks to a drug donation programme by the\nmanufacturing company. Fluconazole is only fungistatic, which\nmay be effective as a secondary prophylaxis, but is less useful as\ninduction therapy when potent fungicidal drugs are needed to\nrapidly bring down the fungal burden. Studies in low-income\nsettings have demonstrated that even short courses of Ampho-\ntericin B (5-7 days) are preferable to treatment with fluconazole\nalone. Flucytosine, the other fungicidal drug, is expensive; and\ndespite its great value in the treatment of CM, remains unlicensed\n\n \n\n \n\nVA\n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "CHAPTER 35 A 32-Year-Old Woman from Malawi With Headache and Blurred Vision\n\nChronic meningitis is commonly associated with immu-\nnosuppression.

It is an oppor-\ntunistic infection, which occurs at advanced stages of immuno-\nsuppression, in HIV mostly at CD4 counts below 100/pL. Patients\nusually present with a sub-acute headache of several days to\nweeks duration. Other common clinical findings are cranial nerve\npalsies (N VI), confusion and impaired consciousness. Altered\nmental state is associated with increased lethality. CM is clinically\nindistinguishable from tuberculous meningitis (TBM), although\nfever and neck stiffness are more common in TBM.\n\nCSF opening pressure is often markedly elevated. Further\nCSF findings are commonly non-specific, and the CSF may even\nbe normal. Diagnosis of CM is made by demonstrating the fungus\nin the CSF. This is traditionally done by light microscopy after\nIndia-Ink staining (Fig. 35.2), but this method is user-dependent\nand the sensitivity is therefore variable. Detection of CrAg e.g. by\nlatex-agglutination test or lateral flow assay (LFA) is better. Fungal\nculture of CSF is required to isolate the organism for antimicrobial\nsusceptibility testing. CM treatment consists of three phases:\ninduction, consolidation, and maintenance. The gold standard is\nan induction therapy with two fungicidal drugs that rapidly\ndecrease the fungal burden in the CSF i.e. combined (liposomal)\namphotericin B plus flucytosine (IV or oral) for the initial 2 weeks,\nfollowed by oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for at least 8 weeks and\nfluconazole maintenance therapy 200mg daily until immune\nreconstitution.\n\nThe reality in many resource-limited settings is however\nhampered by poor drug availability and therefore commonly dif-\nfers from the gold standard. Oral fluconazole is often the only\navailable drug, thanks to a drug donation programme by the\nmanufacturing company. Fluconazole is only fungistatic, which\nmay be effective as a secondary prophylaxis, but is less useful as\ninduction therapy when potent fungicidal drugs are needed to\nrapidly bring down the fungal burden. Studies in low-income\nsettings have demonstrated that even short courses of Ampho-\ntericin B (5-7 days) are preferable to treatment with fluconazole\nalone. Flucytosine, the other fungicidal drug, is expensive; and\ndespite its great value in the treatment of CM, remains unlicensed\n\n \n\n \n\nVA"}}

The family appear to be poor villagers; they live\n\non an imbalanced diet.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Suspected Diagnosis and What Are\nYour Differential Diagnoses?\n\nThe patient presents with a triad of neuropsychiatric changes,\nwatery diarrhoea and a photosensitive dermatitis. This clinical\ntriad — diarrhoea, dermatitis, dementia — is typical of pellagra\n(vitamin B; deficiency). The rainy season, during which the\npatient presents, is not only the peak of malaria transmission\nbut is also the ‘hungry season’. Stocks have been consumed,\nthe new crop is not ready for harvesting yet and in poor, rural\nareas large parts of the population go hungry.\n\nA combination of confusion, diarrhoea and skin changes\nin a sub-Saharan African setting should also prompt any cli-\nnician to rule out HIV infection. Persistent confusion in the\ncontext of HIV is commonly seen in tuberculous meningitis,\ncryptococcal meningitis and progressive multifocal leukoen-\ncephalopathy (PML), or may be caused by the human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV-associated neurocognitive\ndisorder). Both diarrhoea and skin changes of various aetiol-\nogies commonly occur in HIV infection.\n\nA further differential diagnosis to consider in a patient\nwith photosensitive dermatitis, anaemia and neuropsychiat-\nric changes is systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\n\nEven though the clinical presentation is very typical of pel-\nlagra, other differential diagnoses should actively be ruled\nout: A diagnostic HIV test should be carried out. The fact\nthat the patient is currently unable to receive counselling\nand give her consent should not lead to a delay of testing\nbecause its result determines immediate further manage-\nment. Once confusion has settled, the HIV test should be\nrepeated to include a pre- and post-counselling session. In\ncase of a reactive HIV serology, a lumbar puncture should\nbe done to rule out tuberculous or cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nA full blood count would help assess the cause of the\npatient’s clinical anaemia. If normocytic anaemia is found,\ncreatinine should be checked, because chronic kidney disease\nis very commonly seen in the tropics. Patients often present\nlate, and both confusion and dermatitis can be signs of\nuraemia.\n\nIn case of a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia patients\nshould be treated with iron and possibly also receive folic acid\nsubstitution, because a poor diet usually is not limited to just\none nutritional component. B-thalassaemia, commonly seen\nin tropical countries, also presents with microcytic anaemia\nand should be considered if there is no response to iron\n\nsupplementation. In f-thalassaemia the so-called Mentzer\nindex (MCV [fL] : Erythrocyte count [x 10'7/L}) is typically\nbelow 13; in iron deficiency it is above 13.\n\nIntestinal helminth infection can contribute to anaemia.\nBecause reliable stool microscopy may not be feasible in a\nresource-constrained setting, pragmatic anthelmintic treat-\nment appears justifiable. Vitamin B; (niacin) should be sup-\nplemented and it should be evaluated how the family’s diet\ncould be improved despite their poor socioeconomic circum-\nstances. A simple affordable trick is to advise the patient to\neat some of the maize directly from the cob, because it is\nthe husks that harbour tryptophan and that go lost during\npreparation of white maize flour.\n\nIt is a slight irony in this case that the husband is working\nona local chicken farm and still cannot afford a balanced diet\nthat includes eggs and poultry for his family.\n\nThe Case Continued...\nThe HIV test came back negative. The full blood count\n\nshowed a microcytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 6.7 g/\ndL and a Mentzer index >13. The patient received an appro-\npriate dose of vitamin B-complex, iron and folic acid supple-\nmentation and a single dose of albendazole. Her confusion\nsettled within a week and the diarrhoea stopped. The patient\nand her family received dietary counselling. She was pre-\nscribed soothing applications for her skin lesions and was\ntold to avoid sun exposure. She was discharged and asked\nto come back at 3 months for an outpatient follow-up visit\nincluding a repeat full blood count.\n\nALY) G\n\nPellagra\n\nPellagra is a nutritional disorder caused by the deficiency of\nvitamin Bg or its precursor, the essential amino-acid tryptophan.\n‘Pellagra’ is derived from the Italian pelle agra, meaning ‘rough\nskin’. It continues to be a problem in central and southern Africa\nwhere maize is the main staple food. Maize is poor in tryptophan,\nwhich is required for niacin synthesis. In some parts of Africa white\nmaize is mainly consumed, which is nutritionally poorer than the\nyellow maize used in this region as animal feed. Milling maize and\nremoving its husks further deprives it of nutritious components. In\nmany poor African countries with little crop diversity, diet may\nliterally consist of just maize, whereas niacin-containing food\nitems such as fresh fruits, vegetables, peanuts, fish, meat, milk\nand eggs are not affordable. Most nutritional disorders peak\nduring the rainy season, including kwashiorkor and marasmus in\nchildren. Apart from a poor diet, pellagra may be caused by\nmalabsorption, alcoholism, antituberculous treatment and other\naetiologies. The roll-out of INH-preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV\npatients has led to an increase in pellagra cases in some areas in\nAfrica. Single cases of pellagra continue to be described from all\nover the world.\n\nPatients present with the three ‘Ds’ of dermatitis, diarrhoea\nand dementia. The dermatitis often presents in a typical shape\naround the neck, which is referred to as ‘Casal’s necklace’ after\nthe Spanish physician who first described it in poor peasants in\nthe 18th century. The skin tends to be dry, tender to touch and\nexposure to sunlight may be very painful.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "CHAPTER 37 A 29-Year-Old Woman from Malawi With Confusion, Diarrhoea and a Skin Rash", "Discussion": "A young Malawian woman presents during the rainy season\nwith a 1-month history of confusion, acute watery diarrhoea\nand a rash that mainly seems to affect the sun-exposed areas\nof the skin.

POSTELS\n\nClinical Presentation\n\n \n\nHistory\n\nIt is the rainy season in rural eastern Uganda. A 4-year-old girl,\npreviously healthy, is carried into the Accident and Emergency\n(A&E) Department. Her father reports that she was well until\nyesterday. She had a bad headache in the early afternoon but\nlater in the evening developed shaking chills. Believing this\nwas yet another episode of malaria, a common problem in\ntheir village, the family planned to take her to the health centre\nin the morning. The child slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. today the\nfamily woke to find the girl was in the midst of a seizure, which\nlasted about ten minutes. It has taken 4 hours for the family to\nreach A&E and the little girl has not awoken. The child has\nnot had any recent head trauma and the family knows of\nno other reason that the child might be ill.\n\nClinical Findings\n\nHer temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 150 bpm, respi-\nratory rate 36 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure\n98/40 mmHg. She has no neck stiffness or jaundice. Capil-\nlary refill is normal. There is nasal flaring with respirations.\nBlantyre Coma Scale is 1/5. Pupils are 2mm and reactive,\nand extraocular movements are normal by oculocephalic\nmanoeuvres. She has no papilloedema on direct ophthalmos-\ncopy. With stimulation there is decerebrate posturing that\nresolves spontaneously. On cardiac examination she has a\ngallop rhythm.

At 5 a.m. today the\nfamily woke to find the girl was in the midst of a seizure, which\nlasted about ten minutes. It has taken 4 hours for the family to\nreach A&E and the little girl has not awoken. The child has\nnot had any recent head trauma and the family knows of\nno other reason that the child might be ill.", "Clinical Findings": "Her temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 150 bpm, respi-\nratory rate 36 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure\n98/40 mmHg.

There are\nno other investigations required. Antiparasitic treatment can\nbe administered topically or systemically (see Summary Box).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was prescribed a single-dose treatment of iver-\nmectin (200 j1g/kg). The itchy eruptions settled within a\nfew days of taking the drug.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nHookworm-Related Cutaneous Larva Migrans\n\nCLMis a creeping eruption resulting from accidental infestation of\nthe human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms\n(Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense and Uncinaria stenoce-\nphala). \\t is one of the most common dermatoses in returning\ntravellers from tropical destinations. Apart from its relevance in\ntravel medicine, it is endemic in resource-poor communities in the\ndeveloping world, particularly in Central and South America, the\nCaribbean and South and South-east Asia.\n\nCLM occurs in most warm and humid climates and where\nstray dogs and cats are common, or pets are not treated regularly\nwith anthelmintics. The animals pass hookworm ova with their\nstools, and the larval stages develop in sand or soil. CLM is usually\nacquired when walking barefoot, or sitting or lying on faecally\ncontaminated ground.\n\nAnimal hookworm larvae enter the epidermis but are unable to\ncross the basement membrane and enter the human body.\nConfined to the skin, they are unable to complete their lifecycle as\nthey would do in their animal host.\n\nThere usually is a pruritic papule at the site of larval entry.\n\nA raised erythematous track starts progressing in an irregular\nfashion. The onset of symptoms and the speed by which the\ncreeping eruption progresses vary between different hookworm\n\n \n\n \n\nspecies, but usually itching starts shortly after larval entry, and the\nelevated track appears 1 to 5 days later.\n\nThe skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but\nmay occur in any part of the body that came into contact with\ninfested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent\naffected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms\nmay invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia.\n\nDiagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history.\nSkin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in\nadvance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests\navailable, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases.\n\nThe treatment of choice is ivermectin (200p1g/kg for 1-2 days.).\nAlbendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-\ncated or not available. Albendazole 400 mg should be given twice\ndaily (bd) for 3 days.

There are\nno other investigations required. Antiparasitic treatment can\nbe administered topically or systemically (see Summary Box).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was prescribed a single-dose treatment of iver-\nmectin (200 j1g/kg). The itchy eruptions settled within a\nfew days of taking the drug.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nHookworm-Related Cutaneous Larva Migrans\n\nCLMis a creeping eruption resulting from accidental infestation of\nthe human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms\n(Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense and Uncinaria stenoce-\nphala). \\t is one of the most common dermatoses in returning\ntravellers from tropical destinations. Apart from its relevance in\ntravel medicine, it is endemic in resource-poor communities in the\ndeveloping world, particularly in Central and South America, the\nCaribbean and South and South-east Asia.\n\nCLM occurs in most warm and humid climates and where\nstray dogs and cats are common, or pets are not treated regularly\nwith anthelmintics. The animals pass hookworm ova with their\nstools, and the larval stages develop in sand or soil. CLM is usually\nacquired when walking barefoot, or sitting or lying on faecally\ncontaminated ground.\n\nAnimal hookworm larvae enter the epidermis but are unable to\ncross the basement membrane and enter the human body.\nConfined to the skin, they are unable to complete their lifecycle as\nthey would do in their animal host.\n\nThere usually is a pruritic papule at the site of larval entry.\n\nA raised erythematous track starts progressing in an irregular\nfashion. The onset of symptoms and the speed by which the\ncreeping eruption progresses vary between different hookworm\n\n \n\n \n\nspecies, but usually itching starts shortly after larval entry, and the\nelevated track appears 1 to 5 days later.\n\nThe skin eruptions are most commonly found on the feet but\nmay occur in any part of the body that came into contact with\ninfested sand or soil. The itching is intense and may prevent\naffected people from sleeping. Very rarely, animal hookworms\nmay invade the human body leading to pulmonary eosinophilia.\n\nDiagnosis is made clinically, supported by exposure history.\nSkin biopsy is not helpful because the larva is invariably in\nadvance of its track. There are no reliable serological tests\navailable, and blood eosinophilia is present in a minority of cases.\n\nThe treatment of choice is ivermectin (200p1g/kg for 1-2 days.).\nAlbendazole is a good alternative when ivermectin is contraindi-\ncated or not available. Albendazole 400 mg should be given twice\ndaily (bd) for 3 days. Topical thiabendazole 10-15% tds for 5 to\n10 days is also effective but requires more compliance and can be\ndifficult in multiple lesions.\n\nWithout treatment the lesion can persist for several months,\nand scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection, particularly if\nhygiene is poor.\n\nFor prevention at the community level, cats and dogs should\nbe dewormed and banned from beaches and playgrounds. In\nresource-limited settings this is usually not feasible. Individual\nprotection can be achieved by wearing appropriate footwear\nwhen walking on sand or soil in the tropics and using a sunchair\non the beach because towels may be covered with sand and\ntherefore do not protect sufficiently.", "Further Reading": "1.

The mother said that she herself had anorexia, weak-\nness, a husky voice, and paresthesias affecting her limbs —\nsymptoms of thiamine deficiency.\n\nIntravenous thiamine (50 mg) was given immediately to\nthe child after admission and she quickly and dramatically\nresponded. Six hours later the baby was able to breastfeed\nnormally and was discharged the following day. Blood sam-\nples were taken from the child and the mother. Analysis\nshowed that both were thiamine-deficient.\n\nThe mother was given oral thiamine supplementation and\n\nadvised to return to a well-balanced diet including thiamine-\nrich foods.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\n \n\nInfantile Beriberi\n\nInfantile beriberi, or clinical thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in\ninfants, is a largely forgotten, fatal but inexpensively treated dis-\nease. It mainly occurs in South and South-east Asia, where 50 to\n100 years ago it was recognized as a major public health problem.\nIt remains relatively common in Laos, probably because of pro-\nlonged maternal food avoidance during pregnancy and post-\npartum. There is also evidence that it is still of importance in\nCambodia, India and Myanmar, and cases have been reported\nfrom refugee populations in Thailand.\n\nInfantile beriberi occurs in exclusively breastfed babies of\napproximately 2 to 3 months of age, whose mothers have thia-\nmine deficiency resulting from inadequate thiamine intake.\n\nlt commonly manifests mainly as the “wet” form of beriberi,\ncharacterized by heart failure with hepatomegaly and marked\nperipheral oedema. The disease typically presents as shock,\n\n \n\noften preceded by a hoarse cry, grunting, poor breastfeeding,\nirritability, dyspnoea and cyanosis. Clinically unapparent thiamine\ndeficiency was also found to be common among sick infants\nadmitted to the hospitals in Laos.\n\nAthiamine-deficient diet is largely made up of milled, sticky rice\nthat has had most of its thiamine removed as a result of the milling\nprocess. In the late nineteenth century, the advent of mechanical\nrice milling, which removes the main dietary source of thiamine in\nthe rice husk, is thought to be the precipitant for beriberi\nbecoming a major public health problem in Asia, responsible for\nconsiderable mortality. However, there has been very little recent\nepidemiological research, despite evidence that it remains focally\nimportant.\n\nThe pathophysiology of infantile beriberi remains unclear, but\nthe cardinal problem is usually myocardial dysfunction. Thiamine\ndeficiency may also present with a variety of other clinical syn-\ndromes, including encephalopathy, hypoglycemia and lactic\nacidosis.\n\nInfantile beriberi is usually diagnosed clinically because of the\nneed to act before biochemical results are available and the lack\nof laboratories in endemic areas that can perform thiamine bio-\nchemical assays. Treatment of infantile beriberi with thiamine is\nsimple, inexpensive and highly effective. It should be administered\nparenterally to rapidly increase tissue thiamine levels. Thiamine\nsupplementation should also be given to the mothers of infants\nwith beriberi. Education about thiamine-rich foods (e.g. pulses,\ngroundnuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables) and on the\ndanger of food avoidance should be provided before discharge.\nPrevention is crucial: better understanding of post-partum diets,\nand on how to change the practice of food avoidance is very\nimportant and thiamine supplementation for mothers is\nurgently needed.\n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\nTe\n\nAbrams S, Brabin BJ, Coulter JBS.

The mother said that she herself had anorexia, weak-\nness, a husky voice, and paresthesias affecting her limbs —\nsymptoms of thiamine deficiency.\n\nIntravenous thiamine (50 mg) was given immediately to\nthe child after admission and she quickly and dramatically\nresponded. Six hours later the baby was able to breastfeed\nnormally and was discharged the following day. Blood sam-\nples were taken from the child and the mother. Analysis\nshowed that both were thiamine-deficient.\n\nThe mother was given oral thiamine supplementation and\n\nadvised to return to a well-balanced diet including thiamine-\nrich foods.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nInfantile Beriberi\n\nInfantile beriberi, or clinical thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in\ninfants, is a largely forgotten, fatal but inexpensively treated dis-\nease. It mainly occurs in South and South-east Asia, where 50 to\n100 years ago it was recognized as a major public health problem.\nIt remains relatively common in Laos, probably because of pro-\nlonged maternal food avoidance during pregnancy and post-\npartum. There is also evidence that it is still of importance in\nCambodia, India and Myanmar, and cases have been reported\nfrom refugee populations in Thailand.\n\nInfantile beriberi occurs in exclusively breastfed babies of\napproximately 2 to 3 months of age, whose mothers have thia-\nmine deficiency resulting from inadequate thiamine intake.\n\nlt commonly manifests mainly as the “wet” form of beriberi,\ncharacterized by heart failure with hepatomegaly and marked\nperipheral oedema. The disease typically presents as shock,\n\n \n\noften preceded by a hoarse cry, grunting, poor breastfeeding,\nirritability, dyspnoea and cyanosis. Clinically unapparent thiamine\ndeficiency was also found to be common among sick infants\nadmitted to the hospitals in Laos.\n\nAthiamine-deficient diet is largely made up of milled, sticky rice\nthat has had most of its thiamine removed as a result of the milling\nprocess. In the late nineteenth century, the advent of mechanical\nrice milling, which removes the main dietary source of thiamine in\nthe rice husk, is thought to be the precipitant for beriberi\nbecoming a major public health problem in Asia, responsible for\nconsiderable mortality. However, there has been very little recent\nepidemiological research, despite evidence that it remains focally\nimportant.\n\nThe pathophysiology of infantile beriberi remains unclear, but\nthe cardinal problem is usually myocardial dysfunction. Thiamine\ndeficiency may also present with a variety of other clinical syn-\ndromes, including encephalopathy, hypoglycemia and lactic\nacidosis.\n\nInfantile beriberi is usually diagnosed clinically because of the\nneed to act before biochemical results are available and the lack\nof laboratories in endemic areas that can perform thiamine bio-\nchemical assays. Treatment of infantile beriberi with thiamine is\nsimple, inexpensive and highly effective. It should be administered\nparenterally to rapidly increase tissue thiamine levels. Thiamine\nsupplementation should also be given to the mothers of infants\nwith beriberi. Education about thiamine-rich foods (e.g. pulses,\ngroundnuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables) and on the\ndanger of food avoidance should be provided before discharge.\nPrevention is crucial: better understanding of post-partum diets,\nand on how to change the practice of food avoidance is very\nimportant and thiamine supplementation for mothers is\nurgently needed.", "Further Reading": "Te\n\nAbrams S, Brabin BJ, Coulter JBS.

What could be the reasons for the lack of clinical\nimprovement?\n2. Which investigations are indicated?\n\nDiscussion\n\n \n\nA 32-year-old Malawian man who is known to be HIV pos-\nitive is admitted with a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphade-\nnitis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\n(IRIS) of the unmasking type (see Summary Box). The\nTB diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. He unexpect-\nedly deteriorates on antituberculous treatment.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Could Be the Reasons for the Lack of Clinical\nImprovement?\n\nAlthough the diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis is very likely\nwhen AFB are identified in a lymph gland sample, atypical\nmycobacteria should also be considered now that the initial\nresponse to TB treatment is unsatisfactory, especially given\nthe deep immune suppression the patient had at the start\nof ART. Other reasons for a poor response to TB treatment\nare non-adherence, malabsorption and drug resistance.\nGiven the frank fluctuation that is present, a bacterial lymph-\nadenitis is probable, whereas a lymphoma seems much less\n\nlikely.\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhich Investigations Are Indicated?\n\nHIV viral load and a CD4 count should be done to deter-\nmine the response to ART. A repeat FNA should be per-\nformed to check for AFB. A Gram stain and bacterial\nculture should help rule out bacterial superinfection. Ideally,\nthe aspirate should be examined by PCR (XPert MTB/RIF)\nand also be cultured to rule out infection with resistant Myco-\nbacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria (culture).\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient denied missing any tablets, had no diarrhoea or\nother gastrointestinal symptoms, and had not left Malawi,\nwhere multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. IRIS of\nthe paradoxical type was also considered to explain the lack\nof improvement (see Box), therefore corticosteroids were\ninitiated.\n\nFurther investigations were done, with the following\nresults: CD4 109 cells/pL; HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL.\nRepeat FBC results were: WBC 7.8 x 10°/L, haemoglobin\n6.7 g/dL, MCV 84 fL, platelets 428 x 10°/L.\n\nBecause of the increasingly fluctuant swelling in the neck,\na second FNA was done, now showing frank yellowish pus.\nOn microscopic examination, numerous coccoid bacteria\nand polymorphonuclear lymphocytes were observed. Unfor-\ntunately results from a bacterial culture were never received.\n\nsto @lV NOME =i-ar-wae A 32-Year-Old Man from Malawi With a Painfully Swollen Neck\n\nThe diagnosis at this point was superimposed bacterial\nlymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic because of the earlier aspi-\nration, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most likely\nmicroorganism. The patient recovered well after incision\nand drainage, antibiotic treatment and a short course of cor-\nticosteroids while he continued on TB treatment and ART.\n\nIn the first full blood count, severe microcytic anaemia\nwas present. Anaemia is extremely common in patients with\nadvanced HIV immunosuppression and TB co-infection;\nhowever, the marked microcytosis is unusual. There was\nno good explanation for this finding because there was no\nsource of blood loss in the history, and the MCV had nor-\nmalized in the second full blood count, which was against\nB-thalassaemia as a cause of microcytic anaemia. The first full\nblood count also showed a leukocytosis when TB lymphad-\nenitis was diagnosed. This finding is paradoxical because\nlater, when the florid purulent bacterial infection was pre-\nsent, it had resolved. Multiple dynamic factors were appar-\nently influencing the white blood cell count in this\npatient, including HIV, TB, bacterial infection, immune\nreconstitution, corticosteroids, antiretroviral and antituber-\nculous drugs and co-trimoxazole.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome\n\nHIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\n(IRIS) is a deterioration of the clinical situation caused by\nincreased inflammation because of improving immune compe-\ntence resulting from successful ART.\n\nThe clinical manifestations are wide-ranging and depend on\nthe underlying condition, which is mostly an opportunistic infec-\ntion, but can also be a tumour, an autoimmune disease or another\ncondition. In sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculosis and cryptococcal\nmeningitis are the two most important IRIS presentations. IRIS is\nvery common, occurring in between 10 and 25% of patients who\nstart ART. There are no validated tests for IRIS. The diagnosis is\ntherefore clinical.\n\nA widely accepted definition does not exist, although stan-\ndardization has been attempted. Definitions include measures of\nsuccessful ART, exclusion of other causes of the clinical deteri-\noration, such as toxicity, and a relationship in time between the\nsymptoms and the start of ART.\n\nIRIS is classified into two types: In “unmasking IRIS”, a con-\ndition is present but remains subclinical and undiagnosed\nbecause of severe immunosuppression before the start of ART,\nand becomes clinically apparent within 6 months after ART initi-\nation. In “paradoxical IRIS”, a condition has been diagnosed and\nis being treated successfully, but clinical worsening occurs\nbecause of the increased inflammation after immune recovery,\ne.g. after starting ART. Risk factors for HIV-associated para-\ndoxical IRIS include a low pre-ART CD4 count and haemoglobin\nlevel, a high pre-ART viral load, large pre-ART weight loss, large\nand rapid increase of the CD4 count, rapid reduction of the viral\nload on ART and a short period between the start of treatment for\nan opportunistic infection and initiation of ART. Prednisone initi-\nated alongside ART in selected patients with CD4 counts <100\ncells/uL seems to reduce the risk of paradoxical IRIS and is not\nassociated with significant adverse effects.\n\nParadoxical IRIS may also occur in other conditions, e.g. in TB\nalone without HIV co-infection when TB treatment itself induces\nimmune reconstitution.

He had eaten a local dessert\nthe previous day without realizing that it was made of\nreduced milk and had experienced some bloating and dis-\ncomfort, but was otherwise feeling much better.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nGiardiasis\n\nGiardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia),\na flagellate protozoan. The parasite is present throughout the\nworld, with several species found in animals. Not all infections\nresult in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local\npopulations with constant exposure rarely develop disease.\n\nSymptomatic giardiasis is common in travellers to regions of\nSouth and South-east Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin\nAmerica, particularly where clean water supplies and standards of\nfood hygiene are low.\n\nGiardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of\nhumans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause\ndiarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and\npossibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an\nenvironmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool\nand enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel\nmovements. The most common method of infection is by drinking\ncontaminated water. However, people may also become infected\n\n \n\n \n\nthrough hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating\ncontaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and\nunknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of\ngiardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symp-\ntoms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps,\ngas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The\nsymptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer.\nGiardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B,», iron,\nfat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients. Malabsorption\ncan sometimes be prolonged and take several weeks to disap-\npear. Chronic and multiple infections in young children have been\nshown to cause long-term effects on growth leading to stunting.\nThe most common treatment is administration of drugs of the\nnitroimidazole group, with tinidazole being the drug of choice\nfollowed by metronidazole. Tinidazole is effective as a single dose\nof 2g, and metronidazole 500mg is given tds for 5 to 7 days. Non-\nresponsiveness to nitroimidazole treatment is increasingly seen,\nin particular in travellers to South Asia where rates can reach up to\n50%. Other drugs used are e.g. quinacrine, nitazoxanide and\nfurazolidone.\n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n137\n\n \n\n1. Kelly P. Intestinal protozoa. In: Farrar J, editor.

Not all infections\nresult in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local\npopulations with constant exposure rarely develop disease.\n\nSymptomatic giardiasis is common in travellers to regions of\nSouth and South-east Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin\nAmerica, particularly where clean water supplies and standards of\nfood hygiene are low.\n\nGiardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of\nhumans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause\ndiarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and\npossibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an\nenvironmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool\nand enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel\nmovements. The most common method of infection is by drinking\ncontaminated water. However, people may also become infected\n\n \n\n \n\nthrough hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating\ncontaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and\nunknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of\ngiardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symp-\ntoms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps,\ngas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The\nsymptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer.\nGiardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B,», iron,\nfat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients. Malabsorption\ncan sometimes be prolonged and take several weeks to disap-\npear. Chronic and multiple infections in young children have been\nshown to cause long-term effects on growth leading to stunting.\nThe most common treatment is administration of drugs of the\nnitroimidazole group, with tinidazole being the drug of choice\nfollowed by metronidazole. Tinidazole is effective as a single dose\nof 2g, and metronidazole 500mg is given tds for 5 to 7 days. Non-\nresponsiveness to nitroimidazole treatment is increasingly seen,\nin particular in travellers to South Asia where rates can reach up to\n50%. Other drugs used are e.g. quinacrine, nitazoxanide and\nfurazolidone.", "Further Reading": "137\n\n \n\n1. Kelly P. Intestinal protozoa. In: Farrar J, editor. Manson’s Tropical\nDiseases. 23rd ed.

Of note, PMLIRIS possibly accounts for\nnearly 25% of all PML cases in HIV-positive patients. Steroids\nmight have a beneficial effect in the management of PML-IRIS.\nHowever, in a setting with high prevalence of HIV-associated\nopportunistic infections and tuberculosis, it is probably advisable\nto apply steroids only if other common CNS infections are\nexcluded or covered for.", "Further Reading": "1.

Only filoviruses known to cause\nhaemorrhagic fever are shown. Countries where Ebola and Marburg\nhaemorrhagic fevers have been seen are indicated in green and blue,\nrespectively, with countries in red indicating documentation of both dis-\neases. Incidence and risk of disease may vary significantly within each\ncountry. Filoviruses are likely to occur outside these countries but have\nnot yet been recognised. (Reproduced from Farrar, J., Hotez, P.,\nJunghanss, T., et al., 2013. Manson’s Tropical Diseases. Farrar, J.,\nEd. London: Elsevier. Fig. 16.1.)\n\nTo protect laboratory staff all biochemical and haemato-\nlogical tests should be done using near-patient testing if\npossible.\n\nThe public health authorities should be alerted to the pos-\nsibility of a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Ideally testing for\nthis should be organized, but samples are likely to need spe-\ncial shipping arrangements to be taken to a specialized\nlaboratory.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nA presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The\nmalaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falci-\nparum. A sample for Marburg and Ebola PCR was sent in a\nsealed plastic container. The patient was isolated in a side\nroom and all patient contact was carried out while wearing\ngloves. She was treated with IV artesunate and then arte-\nmether/lumefantrine. She was given empirical IV ceftriaxone\nto cover for possible sepsis and was resuscitated with IV fluids.\n\nOver the next few days the patient remained very unwell,\nthen she started to improve. Once she had recovered, she was\nkept in isolation for an additional 2 days and was then\nallowed to return home. The day after her discharge a\n\nA 24-Year-Old Woman from Uganda With Fever and Shock\n\npositive Marburg virus PCR result came back. Had this been\nknown while she was in the hospital, stricter infection con-\ntrol procedures, including double gloves, a mask, goggles and\na disposable (waterproof) surgical gown, would have been\nappropriate.\n\nHer family members, close friends and medical staff were\ninterviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her,\nor her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for\n21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum\nincubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever\nor became unwell during this period was isolated.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nFiloviral Diseases\n\nMarburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are\nboth caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-\nguishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate.\nSymptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever,\nsore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and\nabdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-\nquent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die\ndevelop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular\ncoagulation.\n\nBecause symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in\nmost of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally\nrecognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an\noutbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should\nraise the suspicion towards FHF.\n\nEVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of\nsub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of\nMHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines,\nwhereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating\napes or monkeys.\n\nFiloviruses can spread between people through direct physi-\ncal contact or contact with infected body fluids. Large nosocomial\noutbreaks involving the death of large numbers of medical staff\nhave been recorded. Therefore strict infection control measures\nshould be followed while caring for anyone with a suspected viral\nhaemorrhagic fever. Vaccines against MVD are under develop-\nment but have not yet been tested on humans.\n\nThe preferred method of testing for MVD is with PCR, antigen\ndetection tests are less sensitive and specific.

Only filoviruses known to cause\nhaemorrhagic fever are shown.

(Reproduced from Farrar, J., Hotez, P.,\nJunghanss, T., et al., 2013. Manson’s Tropical Diseases. Farrar, J.,\nEd. London: Elsevier. Fig. 16.1.)\n\nTo protect laboratory staff all biochemical and haemato-\nlogical tests should be done using near-patient testing if\npossible.\n\nThe public health authorities should be alerted to the pos-\nsibility of a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Ideally testing for\nthis should be organized, but samples are likely to need spe-\ncial shipping arrangements to be taken to a specialized\nlaboratory.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nA presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The\nmalaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falci-\nparum. A sample for Marburg and Ebola PCR was sent in a\nsealed plastic container. The patient was isolated in a side\nroom and all patient contact was carried out while wearing\ngloves. She was treated with IV artesunate and then arte-\nmether/lumefantrine. She was given empirical IV ceftriaxone\nto cover for possible sepsis and was resuscitated with IV fluids.\n\nOver the next few days the patient remained very unwell,\nthen she started to improve. Once she had recovered, she was\nkept in isolation for an additional 2 days and was then\nallowed to return home. The day after her discharge a\n\nA 24-Year-Old Woman from Uganda With Fever and Shock\n\npositive Marburg virus PCR result came back. Had this been\nknown while she was in the hospital, stricter infection con-\ntrol procedures, including double gloves, a mask, goggles and\na disposable (waterproof) surgical gown, would have been\nappropriate.\n\nHer family members, close friends and medical staff were\ninterviewed; anyone who had had physical contact with her,\nor her body fluids, was told to monitor their temperature for\n21 days from the time of contact which is the maximum\nincubation period for MHF. Anyone who developed a fever\nor became unwell during this period was isolated.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nFiloviral Diseases\n\nMarburg virus disease (MVD) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are\nboth caused by filoviruses. They are clinically virtually indistin-\nguishable and cause severe illnesses with a high case fatality rate.\nSymptoms are non-specific, and patients may present with fever,\nsore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain and\nabdominal symptoms. Conjunctivitis is common. The most fre-\nquent cause of death is shock. Less than half of those who die\ndevelop haemorrhages because of disseminated intravascular\ncoagulation.\n\nBecause symptoms are non-specific and testing is difficult in\nmost of Africa, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers (FHF) are normally\nrecognized only if a cluster of cases occurs. In particular, an\noutbreak in an endemic area in which health workers die should\nraise the suspicion towards FHF.\n\nEVD and MVD have both been detected over wide areas of\nsub-Saharan Africa. Both are zoonoses of bats. Many cases of\nMHF have been linked to entering or working in caves or mines,\nwhereas cases of EHF are associated with butchering and eating\napes or monkeys.\n\nFiloviruses can spread between people through direct physi-\ncal contact or contact with infected body fluids. Large nosocomial\noutbreaks involving the death of large numbers of medical staff\nhave been recorded. Therefore strict infection control measures\nshould be followed while caring for anyone with a suspected viral\nhaemorrhagic fever. Vaccines against MVD are under develop-\nment but have not yet been tested on humans.\n\nThe preferred method of testing for MVD is with PCR, antigen\ndetection tests are less sensitive and specific. The treatment of\nMVD is supportive. Treatments which have shown promise in\nEVD, such as antibody therapies e.g. ZMAPP or the antiviral drug\nfavipiravir, have not been clinically tested in humans with MVD.", "Further Reading": "1.

An\noverview of rickettsial infections and their vectors is given in\nTable 54.1.\n\nATBF is caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by cattle\nticks of the genus Amblyomma, which act both as reservoir and\nas vector.\n\nOther reservoir hosts are wild and domestic animals, such as\ncattle, buffalos, rhinos, and hippos. ATBF is endemic in most of\nrural sub-Saharan Africa and in the West Indies.\n\nATBF commonly occurs in game hunters, safari tourists,\ncross-country runners and campers in veld areas or grasslands.\nATBF is one of the most common causes of febrile presentations\nin international travellers to sub-Saharan Africa, and it is the most\ncommon rickettsial infection encountered in travel medicine. In\n\n \n\nThe incubation period following the bite of an infected tick is\nabout 6 to 10 days. Patients develop fever and flu-like symptoms\nsuch as myalgias and headache. There may be a characteristic\ninoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphade-\nnopathy. It may however take some time for the pathognomonic\neschar to demarcate and early lesions may be non-specific\nerythematous papules, resembling mosquito bites. Multiple\ninoculation eschars are not uncommon, because Amblyomma\nticks are known to aggressively attack their hosts.\n\nDespite the fact that African tick-bite fever belongs to the\ngroup of ‘spotted fevers’, a rash is seen in less than half of cases.\nATBEF is usually a mild illness and no deaths have been reported\nso far.\n\nHowever, neurological involvement has been described in\nATBF, including encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\nAlso, retinitis and panuveitis have been described.\n\nDiagnosis of ATBF is usually made clinically, but in febrile\nindividuals living in or returning from tropical areas malaria should\nstill be ruled out.\n\nPCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is a non-\ninvasive and sensitive way to confirm the diagnosis of acute\ninfection. Serodiagnosis remains the gold standard for spotted-\nfever group rickettsial infections using seroconversion and\nfourfold antibody titre increases. Its use in clinical decision-\nmaking is however limited because of poor sensitivity during\nacute infection (antibodies are often not detectable within the\nfirst 10-14 days), the indirect nature of diagnostic evidence and\ncross-reaction with other Rickettsiae. The immunofluorescence\nassay (IFA) is currently considered the gold standard\nserological test.\n\nTreatment may not be necessary in mild cases. Doxycycline\n100mg bid PO may be given for 3 to 7 days. In pregnant women\nand in children younger than 8 years of age, macrolides are an\nalternative.\n\nPreventive measures include appropriate clothing, which\nshould be impregnated with pyrethroids, and topical insect\nrepellents applied to the skin.

The patient is cachec-\ntic with cervical lymphadenopathy and abnormal pulmonary\nauscultation. Laboratory investigations show thrombocytosis.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\n\nThe most important differential diagnoses in the given set-\nting are MDR TB, histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomyco-\nsis. TB is highly endemic in Peru and MDR TB is an\nincreasing issue. TB and MDR TB almost always need to\nbe considered when clinical symptoms and evolution, as in\nthis case, are suggestive of the disease. What would be\nunusual about this patient is his origin from a rural area in\nthe central Peruvian Amazon where MDR TB is still uncom-\nmon in comparison with underprivileged districts of Lima\nand other big cities of Peru.\n\nHistoplasmosis can present with recurrent or progressive\npulmonary symptoms that can mimic TB. However, his\npresentation would suggest a chronic form that is more often\nseen in individuals with preexisting chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, which this patient does not have. The\npatient’s age, gender, occupation, origin and clinical symp-\ntoms with a pulmonary focus are all typical of the chronic\nform of paracoccidioidomycosis and make this diagnosis\nthe most likely of the three.

After 3 months of TB\ntreatment for a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tubercu-\nlosis, he shows no clinical improvement. The patient is cachec-\ntic with cervical lymphadenopathy and abnormal pulmonary\nauscultation. Laboratory investigations show thrombocytosis.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\n\nThe most important differential diagnoses in the given set-\nting are MDR TB, histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomyco-\nsis. TB is highly endemic in Peru and MDR TB is an\nincreasing issue. TB and MDR TB almost always need to\nbe considered when clinical symptoms and evolution, as in\nthis case, are suggestive of the disease. What would be\nunusual about this patient is his origin from a rural area in\nthe central Peruvian Amazon where MDR TB is still uncom-\nmon in comparison with underprivileged districts of Lima\nand other big cities of Peru.\n\nHistoplasmosis can present with recurrent or progressive\npulmonary symptoms that can mimic TB. However, his\npresentation would suggest a chronic form that is more often\nseen in individuals with preexisting chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, which this patient does not have. The\npatient’s age, gender, occupation, origin and clinical symp-\ntoms with a pulmonary focus are all typical of the chronic\nform of paracoccidioidomycosis and make this diagnosis\nthe most likely of the three.

The infection is\ncaused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides\nbrasiliensis, which grows as mould in the environment and as\nyeast in tissue and at 37°C. Humans are infected through the\ninhalation of aerosolized conidia (spores) from the soil. In endemic\nareas, initial exposure occurs in childhood and the majority of\nprimary infections remain asymptomatic or subclinical. In those\nwho develop disease, two main clinical forms are observed\n(Table 55.1). The chronic adult form is characterized by pulmo-\nnary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in\nmiddle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often\naccompanied by mucosal lesions. Women of fertile age are rarely\naffected, probably because of a protective effect of oestradiol\npreventing the transformation of the fungus into the yeast stage.\nThe acute juvenile form is seen in children and young adults of\nboth sexes and presents as an acute systemic disease of the\nreticuloendothelial system. Adult patients with advanced HIV\ninfection present a more aggressive acute disease similar to the\njuvenile acute form with extensive pulmonary involvement.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis (yeast\nform) on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nculture. The identification of P. brasiliensis is more difficult in\nsputum than in skin lesions or material from lymph nodes. The\nyeast is easily observed on KOH preparation but its isolation in\nculture is difficult and takes 20 to 30 days. Serological testing is\nuseful for antibody detection and diagnosis, assessing disease\nseverity and monitoring treatment response. Molecular methods\ncould be used instead of culture to confirm the diagnosis but are\nnot yet widely available in resource-limited endemic areas.\n\nTreatment includes azoles for mild and moderate cases.\nItraconazole (200 mg/day for 12 months) is considered the\ndrug of choice. Voriconazole and co-trimoxazole are\nalternatives; the latter is commonly used in Brazil. Amphotericin B\n(cumulative dose of 1-2) is indicated for severe and\nextensive disease. However, the drug is not curative and should\nbe followed by an azole or co-trimoxazole to complete\n12 months’ treatment.\n\nCure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical (i.e.\nabsence of symptoms), mycological (i.e. negative testing),\nradiological (i.e. stability of lung lesions on x-ray for 1 year) and\nimmunological (i.e. decrease of specific antibodies).\n\nRecently case reports of severe and unusual extrapulmonary\nmanifestations of paracoccidioidomycosis have been described\nin HTLV-1 infected patients and the two conditions might be\nassociated.\n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.\n\n \n\nHay RJ.

She deliv-\nered a normal infant at term.\n\n \n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nSyphilis in Pregnancy\n\nPrimary syphilis causes an ulcer or chancre, at the site of inoc-\nulation, which is usually painless. Women are often unaware of the\nlesion, because it may be on the cervix or vaginal wall. The sec-\nondary stage usually occurs 6 to 8 weeks later, causing a gen-\neralized rash that often affects the palms of the hands, and usually\ndoes not itch. There may be other manifestations, including\njaundice or ocular involvement (uveitis). The clinical signs resolve\nover a few weeks in the absence of treatment, after which the\npatient enters the latent stage. A small minority develop tertiary\nlesions involving the cardiovascular or nervous system many\nyears later. Progression may be more rapid in HIV-positive\npatients. Women with secondary syphilis, who have a\n\n \n\nA 21-Year-Old Pregnant Woman from The Gambia With a Rash\n\ndisseminated infection, are most likely to infect their foetus, but\nthe infection can cross the placenta in pregnant women with\nlatent syphilis.\n\nAccording to current WHO estimates, syphilis in pregnancy\ncauses 355,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes per year, includ-\ning 143,000 early foetal deaths and stillbirths and 61,000 neonatal\ndeaths. These could be prevented if all pregnant women were\nscreened for syphilis, and treated with a single dose of penicillin if\nthey test positive, before 28 weeks’ gestation.\n\nSerological tests for syphilis are either treponemal (e.g. TRHA,\nTPPA), or non-treponemal (e.g. RPR or VDRL). Treponemal tests\nremain positive for life, whereas non-treponemal tests usually\nrevert to negative after successful treatment, and can therefore be\nused as a test of cure. They may give false-positive results\nbecause of other infections (e.g. malaria), or autoimmune dis-\neases. Until recently it has not been possible to screen women\nattending antenatal clinics that do not have access to a labora-\ntory. However, sensitive and specific treponemal point-of-care\ntests are now available at an affordable price (<$1) which can give\naresult in 15 minutes and require neither electricity nor laboratory\nequipment.\n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.\n\nRichens J, Mayaud P, Mabey DCW.

Women are often unaware of the\nlesion, because it may be on the cervix or vaginal wall. The sec-\nondary stage usually occurs 6 to 8 weeks later, causing a gen-\neralized rash that often affects the palms of the hands, and usually\ndoes not itch. There may be other manifestations, including\njaundice or ocular involvement (uveitis). The clinical signs resolve\nover a few weeks in the absence of treatment, after which the\npatient enters the latent stage. A small minority develop tertiary\nlesions involving the cardiovascular or nervous system many\nyears later. Progression may be more rapid in HIV-positive\npatients. Women with secondary syphilis, who have a\n\n \n\nA 21-Year-Old Pregnant Woman from The Gambia With a Rash\n\ndisseminated infection, are most likely to infect their foetus, but\nthe infection can cross the placenta in pregnant women with\nlatent syphilis.\n\nAccording to current WHO estimates, syphilis in pregnancy\ncauses 355,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes per year, includ-\ning 143,000 early foetal deaths and stillbirths and 61,000 neonatal\ndeaths. These could be prevented if all pregnant women were\nscreened for syphilis, and treated with a single dose of penicillin if\nthey test positive, before 28 weeks’ gestation.\n\nSerological tests for syphilis are either treponemal (e.g. TRHA,\nTPPA), or non-treponemal (e.g. RPR or VDRL). Treponemal tests\nremain positive for life, whereas non-treponemal tests usually\nrevert to negative after successful treatment, and can therefore be\nused as a test of cure. They may give false-positive results\nbecause of other infections (e.g. malaria), or autoimmune dis-\neases. Until recently it has not been possible to screen women\nattending antenatal clinics that do not have access to a labora-\ntory. However, sensitive and specific treponemal point-of-care\ntests are now available at an affordable price (<$1) which can give\naresult in 15 minutes and require neither electricity nor laboratory\nequipment.", "Further Reading": "1.\n\nRichens J, Mayaud P, Mabey DCW.

The patient’s general\ncondition improved significantly within the first week\nand vomiting stopped. Diarrhoea subsided after 2 weeks\nof treatment.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\n \n\nIntestinal Capillariasis\n\nIntestinal capillariasis is a zoonotic disease caused by C. philip-\npinensis, a tiny nematode usually infecting fish-eating birds, which\n\n \n\n° Fig. 58.2 Adult C. philippinensis in the patient’s stool sample during\ntreatment with mebendazole.\n\nrecently has been transferred to the genus Paracapillaria.\nHumans are accidentally infected when eating raw or under-\ncooked small fresh- or brackish-water fish harbouring infective\nlarval stages of the parasite. Adult parasites invade the wall of the\nsmall intestine and live partially embedded in the mucosa of\njejunum and ileum. The unique life cycle includes an alteration of\noviparous and larviparous females. Oviparous females shed\nthick-shelled eggs, which exit the body with the stool and, after\nbeing eaten by small fish, develop into the infective larvae. Lar-\nviparous females contain thin-shelled eggs, which mainly hatch\nin utero and permit an internal autoinfection and multiplication\ncycle, i.e. larvae develop into adults within the intestinal mucosa\nwithout leaving the host. This leads to a gradual increase of both\nworm burden and severity of clinical manifestations. With its\nautoinfection cycle, the parasite is one of the few intestinal hel-\nminths causing chronic and life-threatening infections. Patients\npresent with colicky abdominal pain and intermittent or chronic\ndiarrhoea accompanied by anorexia, vomiting and dehydration.\nWithout treatment, infection progresses to severe enteropathy\nwith crypt atrophy and flattening of villi. Chronically infected\npatients suffer cachexia and pitting oedema of the lower limbs.\nUntreated, they may eventually die of severe protein loss, elec-\ntrolyte imbalance and concomitant bacterial infections. Parasi-\ntological diagnosis relies on the demonstration of typical peanut-\nshaped eggs in stool samples, which have protruding polar plugs\non both ends and measure 36 to 42 x 20 pm.

The\nskin lesions are typical for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). The pres-\nence of palatal lesions supports this possibility and increases\nyour suspicion of pulmonary involvement.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Approach This Patient?\n\nThe patient should be assessed for possible pulmonary tuber-\nculosis, which should include a urine LAM, sputum micros-\ncopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), Xpert MTB/RIF and chest\nradiograph where necessary. Where available, bronchoscopy\nremains the gold standard investigation for endobronchial\nKS. Dual pathology of pulmonary KS and TB is not uncom-\nmon, and a high index of suspicion for TB should be main-\ntained, particularly as TB remains responsible for many\nHIV-related deaths.\n\nThe main concern of the patient and primary caregiver\nshould be recorded to assist with prioritizing interventions\nthat promote quality of life. These concerns may be physical,\npsychological, social or spiritual. General positive living\nadvice, including safe sexual practice, screening for STIs\nand partner(s) and children testing for HIV, may also be\naddressed. The diagnosis should be explained to the patient\nin a style and language which is supportive and understand-\nable. The practitioner should allow time for questions and\nexploration of relevant issues, which can assist with planning.\nSuch communication can facilitate the development of real-\nistic expectations from the start of the therapeutic process.\n\nThe patient should be started on antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) as soon as possible both to control HIV and as part\nof the therapeutic response to KS. There is a small possibility\nof KS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome,\nrecognizable as worsening disease some weeks after com-\nmencement of ART.\n\nAdjuvant palliative chemotherapy is indicated for patients\nwith pulmonary KS.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nHis main concern was shortness of breath. His wife was also\nHIV-positive but not on ART, and his two children 6 and\n4 years old had not yet been tested. His CD4 count was\n134 cells/pL, HB 10.2 g/dL and MCV 88.4 fL. Other\nparameters were normal.\n\nHis chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifica-\ntions in the lower and mid zones of the lungs (Fig. 59.3).\nPeribronchovascular changes are typically seen in patients\nwith pulmonary KS.\n\nSputum and GeneXpert tests were negative for the pres-\nence of tuberculosis.

The incidence of\nKS is on the decline globally as a result of prevention of disease\nbecause of early initiation of ART. KS is caused by human\nherpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-\nassociated herpes virus (KSHV). KS commonly affects the skin\nbut may also involve lymph nodes, lungs and the gastrointestinal\ntract. Diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical\nappearance though biopsy is recommended.\n\nEndemic KS does occur in HIV-uninfected individuals, typically\nwith a more indolent course. All HIV infected patients with KS\nshould be started on ART. For those with more extensive cuta-\nneous disease or visceral involvement, combining antiretroviral\nmedication with chemotherapeutic agents promotes optimal\ntumour regression. Agents such as liposomal doxorubicin,\npaclitaxel, bleomycin, vincristine, vinblastine and etoposide can\nbe considered. Drug availability, access to safe chemotherapy\nadministration, contraindications and side effects of particular\nagents should be considered with reference to the patient and the\nsetting. Tumour response to immunomodulating agents has been\ndemonstrated in a small study in the USA. Outcomes remain poor\nfor patients with extensive visceral disease (AIDS Clinical Trials\nGroup stage T1).

Humans are accidental hosts. Gnathos-\ntomiasis is endemic throughout areas where large amounts\n\nof raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans are\nconsumed, most importantly in East and South-East Asia and\nCentral and South America. Case reports are emerging from\nSouthern Africa.\n\nAdult worms infect the gastrointestinal tract of feline and\ncanine species. When eggs excreted through the faeces get into\nwater, first-stage larvae hatch, which then infect small freshwater\ncrustaceans. A large variety of animals can act as a second\nintermediate host. Humans become infected by eating raw or\nundercooked meat of intermediate hosts, such as freshwater fish,\ncrabs, shrimps, frogs, snakes, fowl and pork. Gnathostomiasis\ncommonly occurs in outbreaks.\n\nLarvae penetrate the human intestinal wall and wander around\nthe body. Initial symptoms are non-specific and may include\nfever, malaise, vomiting and diarrhoea lasting for 2 to 3 weeks.\nThis is accompanied by marked eosinophilia. Within 1 month\ncutaneous infection may develop, manifesting as non-pitting\noedematous migratory swellings that may be pruritic or painful\nand mainly affect the trunk and the proximal limbs. Visceral\ndisease occurs when the larvae migrate through the internal\norgans such as the lungs, gut, genitourinary tract, eye and CNS.\nCNS invasion may manifest as eosinophilic meningoencephalitis,\nsubarachnoid haemorrhages, cranial neuritis or painful radiculo-\nmyelitis as a result of invasion of the spinal cord. Diagnosis is\nsuggested by eosinophilia, migratory swellings and a history of\ngeographical and food exposure. Gnathostomiasis is confirmed\nwhen demonstration of the parasite is made microscopically,\nradiologically or on positive serological examination up to\n3 months after presentation. Lumbar puncture and cranial\nimaging may be necessary in suspected CNS disease. CSF is\noften xanthochromic and may show eosinophilia. Imaging may\nreveal larval tracks within the brain and cord parenchyma.\nTreatment consists of albendazole 400 mg bid for 21 days and/or\nivermectin 200 pg/kg on two consecutive days.

Homozygous HbSS\nleads to sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form of SCD. Sickle\ncell disease is the commonest hereditary haematological\ndisorder.\n\nHbS has the tendency to polymerize during hypoxia. This\nleads to a reduction of the flexibility of the erythrocyte and to the\ntypical sickle shape of the affected cell. Sickled red blood cells\nlead to haemolysis and vaso-occlusion.\n\nThe disease is characterized by episodes of acute illness\nagainst a background of progressive organ damage. Any organ\ncan be affected by SCD at any age; however, certain features\ntend to predominate in certain age-groups. Leg ulcers tend to\nmanifest in adulthood. Pathophysiology is complex and remains\nincompletely understood. Ulcers in SCD occur in areas with thin\nskin and little subcutaneous fat, most commonly on the ankles.\nThey are notoriously difficult to treat. The ulcers are slow to heal\nand are characterized by unexplained relapses. They are com-\nmonly very painful and patients may occasionally require opioids\nfor pain control. Colonization with pathogenic bacteria is com-\nmon. Periosteal reaction is usually seen in the underlying bones\nbut osteomyelitis is uncommon.\n\nOf the many treatments, the most certain to aid healing is\ncomplete bed rest with leg elevation. Oral zinc sulphate tablets\n(200mg tid) have been shown to be helpful. Systemic antibiotic\ntherapy is given in acute sepsis. The use of hydroxyurea in leg\nulcers is controversial. Chronic transfusion regimens to maintain\nthe haemoglobin level above 10g/dL may help when conser-\nvative therapy fails. Skin grafting for clean wounds is recom-\nmended, especially when the defect is large. The relapse rate is\nhigh, however. Poor nutrition which has not been given much\nattention may be a crucial factor and needs to be investigated on\na wide scale in sickle cell disease.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "CHAPTER 62 A 28-Year-Old Man from Ghana With a Chronic Ulcer on His Ankle | (7A)\n\nFasting blood sugar and wound swab for culture and sen-\nsitivity as well as a radiograph of the left leg should be done\nto rule out other differential diagnoses and osteomyelitis.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nBlood was taken and the available results are shown in\nTable 62.1.

For unknown reasons, ectopic\nworms lodge in the venous plexus around the CNS instead of\ntheir normal habitat. Laminectomy with biopsy of the nervous\ntissue is the only method that gives a definite diagnosis of\nSCS. However, this procedure should be avoided because of\nits risks. Diagnosis is based upon spinal cord imaging and\nproof of exposure to the parasite. Urine should be examined\nfor S. haematobium eggs; for S. mansoni, stool microscopy\nmay be attempted but lacks sensitivity, which is much higher\nfor rectal biopsies. The circulating cathodic antigen (CCA)\ntest is a urine antigen test, which may prove S. mansoni\ninfection. It detects an antigen regurgitated by adult worms of\nS. mansoni. It is less sensitive for S. haematobium and\ngenerally works better if the parasite burden is high. A novel\ntest for the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) is under devel-\nopment and seems to be more promising for proof of both\nparasite species in urine and blood.

The cardiovascular manifesta-\ntions of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impal-\npable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure and quiet\nheart sounds are indicative of pericardial effusion. The pres-\nence of syncope, pulsus paradoxus and hypotension are signs\nof cardiac tamponade indicating the need for a therapeutic\npericardial aspiration. In Africa there are several causes of\npericardial effusion that include tuberculosis, other bacterial\ninfections, malignancy and HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma.\nThe presence of a previous attack of herpes zoster is a strong\npointer to HIV infection, and in this case the most likely\ndiagnosis is HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Other Investigations Should be Carried Out?\nOutline the Immediate and Long-Term\nManagement of His Condition.\n\nThe most important investigation that should be carried out\nimmediately is an ultrasound of the heart, which should\nshow the presence of pericardial fluid and sometimes fibrous\nstrands that are strongly suggestive of tuberculosis, especially\nin highly endemic areas. An electrocardiogram is useful in\nshowing low-voltage QRS complexes and in occasional cases\nthere may be electrical alternans. If there is pericardial fluid\non ultrasound, the patient requires a therapeutic pericardial\naspiration to relieve the pressure on the heart and restore car-\ndiac output. Once fluid is aspirated and the cardiac output is\nrestored, the patient should be started on antituberculous\ntreatment and corticosteroids. An HIV test should be carried\nout with appropriate counselling, and consideration given to\nstarting antiretroviral therapy after a few weeks if the HIV\ntest is positive.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration and\n500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid were aspirated. The\nblood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immedi-\nately. The patient was started on standard first-line antituber-\nculous treatment with rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H),\npyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) and also on predniso-\nlone at a dose of 60 mg daily. HIV testing was carried out and\nthe patient was found to be HIV positive.\n\nThe patient received a full 6-month course of antituber-\nculous treatment consisting ofa 2-month initial phase of four\ndrugs given daily (2RHZE) and a 4-month continuation\nphase of two drugs given daily (4RH), prednisolone in\n\nit: > Gly NSME =i Seeley A 32-Year-Old Man from Malawi With Pain in the Right Upper Abdomen and a Feeling of Faintness\n\ntapered doses for ten weeks, and antiretroviral therapy which\nwas started at 4 weeks after commencing antituberculous\ntreatment. He made a full and uneventful recovery.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nTuberculosis\n\nIn Africa the most common cause of pericardial effusion is\ntuberculosis; and even if there is no confirmatory evidence of\ntuberculosis, patients must be treated with a full course of\nantituberculosis treatment. In countries in central and southern\nAfrica there is a strong association between tuberculosis and\nHIV infection, with over 50 per cent of tuberculosis patients\nbeing HIV positive. The advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\nAfrica was associated with a large increase in the number of\npatients being diagnosed with tuberculosis pericardial effusion.\nOnce in HIV-positive patients not yet on ART, a diagnosis of\npericardial effusion is made, it is important to determine\nwhether tamponade is present, with the characteristic features\nbeing syncope, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus and hypoten-\nsion. The presence of tamponade is potentially life-threatening\nand requires prompt pericardial aspiration. Diagnostic peri-\ncardial aspiration is usually unhelpful in the district hospital\nsetting, because the fluid is often bloodstained and acid-fast\nbacilli are rarely visualized in smears of the pericardial aspirate\nfrom patients who have tuberculosis. If pericardial fluid is\navailable for investigation, this can be examined with higher\ndiagnostic sensitivity using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid,\nSunnyvale, CA, USA) — a fully automated and commercially\navailable cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test — which\nallows a confirmed diagnosis of TB within 2 hours. The use of\ncorticosteroids is recommended, especially if there is tampo-\nnade. In HIV-negative patients and HIV-positive patients on\nantiretroviral therapy, randomized controlled trials have shown\nthat corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death. For HIV-\npositive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may\nreduce pericardial constriction. A commonly used regimen is\nprednisolone administered in tapering doses during the first ten\nweeks of antituberculous treatment. WHO guidelines recom-\nmend that antiretroviral therapy is started within 2 to 8 weeks of\nthe start of antituberculosis treatment. Timely antiretroviral\ntherapy reduces mortality, is associated with excellent immu-\nnological and virological responses and reduces the risk of\nrecurrent tuberculosis.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n1.

She\nhas a low-grade fever, but her chest is clear.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What is It\nCaused By?\n\nThe most important diagnosis to consider is Stevens—Johnson\nsyndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis. This potentially\nlife-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction is\nmost commonly caused by drugs. Its incidence is much higher\nin HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. IfSJS involves\nmore than 30% of the skin surface, it is called toxic epidermal\nnecrolysis (TEN). SJS/TEN may lead to widespread epi-\ndermal detachment and erosions of the mucous membranes.\nNon-specific prodromal symptoms suchas cough, sore throat,\nfever, headache and myalgias usually precede the rash by sev-\neral days and may be mistaken for a bacterial or viral infection,\nor for malaria in a tropical setting.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Would You Approach the Patient?\n\nSJS/TEN is a clinical diagnosis. Once suspected, all poten-\ntially causative drugs should be immediately withdrawn. If\nin doubt, all drugs need to be stopped. In general, medica-\ntions initiated 2 to 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms\nare usually responsible. In this patient’s case, the major cul-\nprit drugs were nevirapine and co-trimoxazole.\n\nThe patient at this stage only had a maculopapular rash.\nHowever, patients with SJS/TEN often develop large bullous\nskin lesions. Once they break open, this leads to considerable\nloss of serous fluid, similar to a burn. Therefore, patients with\nSJS/TEN ideally should be managed in a burns unit. Topical\nantiseptics will reduce skin colonization; however, wound\ndebridement is not recommended. Steroid eye drops should\nbe given in case of conjunctivitis, and early ophthalmological\nreview should be sought to prevent conjunctival scarring and\nblindness. Patients need careful management of fluids and\nelectrolytes and high caloric nutrition. A nasogastric (NG)\ntube is often helpful until the mucosal lesions have healed.\nFever may be part of the clinical picture and there is no role\nfor prophylactic antibiotics unless there are signs of sepsis.\nVital signs need to be checked regularly, and blood cultures\nand full blood count taken repeatedly.\n\nA urinary catheter should be inserted to prevent urethral\nstrictures. Skin and mucosal lesions in SJS/TEN are very\npainful. Often, opioids are necessary to control the pain.\n\nUpon discharge, patients should be urged to avoid the\nculprit drug and this should be clearly stated in the patient’s\ndocuments.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nAntiretroviral drugs and co-trimoxazole were stopped on\nadmission. Because the patient was febrile, blood cultures\nand a rapid malaria test were taken and both came back neg-\native. She received IV fluids and a urinary catheter.

Fever and cough settled\nspontaneously. She was discharged after 10 days in hospital.\n\nWhen all lesions had completely healed, she was started\non a new antiretroviral combination therapy and nevirapine\nwas replaced by efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole was not replaced\nbecause there were no alternative drugs available. The new\ndrug combination was tolerated well and no further rash\noccurred.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nStevens—Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal\nNecrolysis\n\nSUS is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity\nreaction. It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SUS, less\nthan 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30%\nis affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\nBetween 10% and 30% it is classified as ‘SUS/TEN overlap’.\nThe extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for\nprognosis.\n\nIn Western industrialized countries, SUS/TEN is considered\nrare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year.\nHowever, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive\nindividuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and\nother high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this\ncondition.\n\nThe drugs most commonly implicated in SUS/TEN are\nantibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes),\nthe antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol.\n\nInfectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV)\nmay also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play\na role.\n\nThe pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of\nan unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of\nkeratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis.\n\nSJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms.\nAfter several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more\nand more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to\nflaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis\n(Fig. 68.2), which causes intense pain. Conjunctivitis is com-\nmon and may lead to scarring and blindness. Involvement of the\noral mucosa and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips make it\ndifficult for the patient to eat, drink and talk. Involvement of the\nurogenital mucosa is very painful and may lead to urethral\nstrictures. The oesophagus and trachea may also be affected.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "CHAPTER 68 A 31-Year-Old Woman from Malawi With a Generalized Mucocutaneous Rash\n\nantiretroviral triple therapy with d4T, 3TC and NVP.

A nasogastric (NG)\ntube is often helpful until the mucosal lesions have healed.\nFever may be part of the clinical picture and there is no role\nfor prophylactic antibiotics unless there are signs of sepsis.\nVital signs need to be checked regularly, and blood cultures\nand full blood count taken repeatedly.\n\nA urinary catheter should be inserted to prevent urethral\nstrictures. Skin and mucosal lesions in SJS/TEN are very\npainful. Often, opioids are necessary to control the pain.\n\nUpon discharge, patients should be urged to avoid the\nculprit drug and this should be clearly stated in the patient’s\ndocuments.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nAntiretroviral drugs and co-trimoxazole were stopped on\nadmission. Because the patient was febrile, blood cultures\nand a rapid malaria test were taken and both came back neg-\native. She received IV fluids and a urinary catheter. The\n\n \n\n¢ Fig. 68.2 The right leg of another patient with SUS/TEN showing exten-\nsive epidermal sloughing and large areas of denuded dermis.\n\npatient and her family declined an NG tube, because they\nhad observed that patients who had an NG tube or oxygen\nprobes were more likely to die than patients who did not have\nsuch devices.\n\nThe patient was given 0.9% normal saline as mouthwash\nand. dexamethasone eye ointment. Fever and cough settled\nspontaneously. She was discharged after 10 days in hospital.\n\nWhen all lesions had completely healed, she was started\non a new antiretroviral combination therapy and nevirapine\nwas replaced by efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole was not replaced\nbecause there were no alternative drugs available. The new\ndrug combination was tolerated well and no further rash\noccurred.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nStevens—Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal\nNecrolysis\n\nSUS is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity\nreaction. It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SUS, less\nthan 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30%\nis affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\nBetween 10% and 30% it is classified as ‘SUS/TEN overlap’.\nThe extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for\nprognosis.\n\nIn Western industrialized countries, SUS/TEN is considered\nrare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year.\nHowever, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive\nindividuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and\nother high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this\ncondition.\n\nThe drugs most commonly implicated in SUS/TEN are\nantibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes),\nthe antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol.\n\nInfectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV)\nmay also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play\na role.\n\nThe pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of\nan unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of\nkeratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis.\n\nSJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms.\nAfter several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more\nand more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to\nflaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis\n(Fig. 68.2), which causes intense pain. Conjunctivitis is com-\nmon and may lead to scarring and blindness. Involvement of the\noral mucosa and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips make it\ndifficult for the patient to eat, drink and talk. Involvement of the\nurogenital mucosa is very painful and may lead to urethral\nstrictures. The oesophagus and trachea may also be affected."}}

Neuro-\ncassavism (konzo) may also present with a sudden-onset spas-\ntic paraparesis but is improbable in the absence of cassava\nexposure.

Treatment is symptomatic\nwith anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy. Tendon and\n\nmuscle release surgery can be employed to lengthen contrac-\ntures of calf muscles and hip adductors. Walking canes, foot\nbraces and wheelchairs need to be provided.\n\nEducation to avoid consumption of L. sativus and mea-\nsures to reduce toxin burden are important public health\ninterventions. New cases of this preventable disease continue\nto occur. Behaviour change communication among high-risk\ncommunities can promote positive practices to reduce toxin\nexposure. Such practices include the use of metallic cooking\nutensils rather than traditional clay pots to avoid accrued tox-\nicity from iron-induced oxidation, addition of antioxidant\nseasonings, soaking seeds in lemon water and avoiding\nunripe seeds.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient received physiotherapy and muscle relaxants;\nhowever, this achieved only mild short-lasting improvement\nof his spasticity.

He was diagnosed with hypertension\n2 years prior. It is unclear if his renal incompetence is a cause\nor the result of his raised blood pressure.\n\nThe reason for the enlargement of his kidneys could either\nbe primary (e.g. polycystic kidneys) or secondary as a result of\npost-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis. In renal com-\npromise secondary to hypertension, one would expect the\nkidneys to be small.\n\nBeing a fisherman, the patient has been in regular contact\nwith Schistosoma haematobium-infested water in Lake\nMalawi. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis is\none of the top differential diagnoses to suspect.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Further Investigations Would You Like to\nPerform to Establish the Diagnosis?\n\nThe most useful investigation at this point is an ultrasound of\nthe kidneys to differentiate between, primary renal patholog-\nical condition and a post-renal problem. If there was hydro-\nnephrosis, obstruction at the level of the bladder seems most\nlikely because both kidneys appear enlarged.\n\nOn cystoscopy, endoscopists can macroscopically estab-\nlish the diagnosis, but ideally, biopsies should be performed\nto look for evidence of granulomatous inflammation and S.\nhaematobium ova in the tissue and to rule out neoplasia.

She looks ill and is septic on admission.\nFBC shows a normal white cell count but slight thrombocy-\ntopenia. The liver transaminases are slightly raised, but bili-\nrubin and AP are normal. CSF shows slight lymphocytic\npleocytosis, a mildly raised protein and a slightly decreased\nglucose. Brain CT scan shows no abnormalities.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat Clinical Sign Will You be Specifically\nLooking for?\n\nLymphadenopathy in the right axilla was detected on clinical\nexamination of the patient. Her acute presentation with\nsigns of severe sepsis make an infectious aetiology of the\nregional lymphadenopathy most likely. It is crucial to per-\nform a meticulous examination in order to establish the port\nof entry of the microorganisms, which should be found in the\nskin area that drains to the enlarged regional lymph nodes.\n\nIn Asia, infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causa-\ntive pathogen of scrub typhus, is a common cause of\nfever, which is often associated with an eschar at the inocu-\nlation site and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes.\nHowever, the prevalence of eschar varies in different popula-\ntions and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis of scrub\n\ntyphus.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Antibiotic Would You Include in Your\nEmpirical Regimen?\n\nIn Asia, scrub typhus must be considered in every patient\npresenting with an undifferentiated febrile illness, regardless\nof the presence or absence of an eschar.\n\nTherefore doxycycline should be added to the empirical\nregimen to cover for O. tsutsugamushi infection. Doxycycline\nwould also cover important differential diagnoses such as\nother rickettsial infections and leptospirosis.\n\nChloramphenicol or azithromycin is the accepted alterna-\ntive treatment if tetracyclines are contraindicated, as is the\ncase in pregnant women or patients with tetracycline hyper-\nsensitivity. Children at any age with scrub typhus can be\nsafely treated with doxycycline.\n\nOf note, acute hearing loss or hearing impairment in a\nfebrile patient from Asia should always arouse strong suspi-\ncion of scrub typhus. However, no single clinical sign or lab-\noratory test can rule in or rule out scrub typhus; therefore\nempirical antirickettsial treatment is given based on clinical\nand epidemiological evidence. A definitive laboratory diag-\nnosis — if at all possible in the particular setting — can be\nestablished by demonstration of seroconversion in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples or by PCR on pre-\ntreatment buffy coat samples of an eschar biopsy.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nOn day 2 after admission the patient developed coarse\ntremors of both upper and lower limbs associated with sac-\ncadic oscillations of her eyes in all directions with further\ndeterioration of level of consciousness (GCS 8). At this point\na careful clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated\ncrater-like lesion in the right axilla hidden within the axillary\nfolds. Doxycycline therapy was commenced and the patient\nimproved over the next 48 hours. She was discharged on day\n6 after admission. Her hearing had returned to normal and\nthere were no other neurological deficits.\n\nThe patient’s O. tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre came back\nhigh (>1:4096), supporting the suspected diagnosis of scrub\ntyphus.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nScrub Typhus\n\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of\nAsia and northern Australia. Its epidemiology has long been\nconsidered limited to the Asia-Pacific area but in 2016 was also\nfirst described in patients from South America.\n\nScrub typhus belongs to the tropical rickettsial\ninfections and is caused by O. tsutsugamushi. The infection is\ntransmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a\ntrombiculid mite.\n\nInfected mite larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats,\nfrom scrubs and primary forests to gardens, beaches, bamboo\nfields and oil palm or rubber estates. Reservoirs of O. tsutsu-\ngamushi are rodents and the mites themselves, which can\nmaintain the infection by vertical transmission. Humans are\naccidental hosts.\n\nThe incubation period is 6 to 10 days. A painless papule\noccurs at the site of the bite, which later ulcerates and trans-\nforms into a black crust or ‘eschar’. Patients present with fever,\nsevere headache and myalgia, regional or generalized lymph-\nadenopathy and, at times, a macular or maculopapular rash.\nConjunctival suffusions, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as\nconstipation can occur.\n\nCNS involvement is common in scrub typhus, and\npresentations with diffuse encephalopathy or a reversible sen-\nsorineural deafness are well documented. In contrast, focal\nneurological signs are rare. Cerebellar, brainstem and extrapy-\nramidal manifestations have been reported, including opsoclo-\nnus, myoclonus and parkinsonian tremor. Further complications\ninclude myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS and renal\nfailure. Immunity is short-lived and strain-specific.\n\nDiagnosis can be challenging and, in many resource-limited\nsettings, remains clinical. The diagnostic gold standard is the\ndocumentation of a significant rise in antibody titres in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples. However, these\nserological tests are usually unavailable in resource-poor\ntropical areas. Despite controversies in sensitivity and speci-\nficity, inmunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests have\nbeen developed for field use and are being used in the diag-\nnosis of scrub typhus in several endemic countries. ELISA-\nbased tests have a high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-based\ntests have been developed and are mostly employed in\ngenotypic characterization and for research purposes or as\ndiagnostic tools in high-resource settings. Culture of O. tsut-\nsugamushi from the blood takes several weeks and requires a\nbiosafety level 3 facility.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f", "sections": {"body": "CHAPTER 70 A 58-Year-Old Woman from Sri Lanka With Fever, Deafness and Confusion", "Discussion": "A 58-year-old woman who is a rural resident of Sri Lanka\npresents in a septic state with confusion and hearing loss.\nOn examination there is a regional axillary lymphadenopathy\non the right side.

It is crucial to per-\nform a meticulous examination in order to establish the port\nof entry of the microorganisms, which should be found in the\nskin area that drains to the enlarged regional lymph nodes.\n\nIn Asia, infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causa-\ntive pathogen of scrub typhus, is a common cause of\nfever, which is often associated with an eschar at the inocu-\nlation site and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes.\nHowever, the prevalence of eschar varies in different popula-\ntions and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis of scrub\n\ntyphus.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\n\nWhat Antibiotic Would You Include in Your\nEmpirical Regimen?\n\nIn Asia, scrub typhus must be considered in every patient\npresenting with an undifferentiated febrile illness, regardless\nof the presence or absence of an eschar.\n\nTherefore doxycycline should be added to the empirical\nregimen to cover for O. tsutsugamushi infection. Doxycycline\nwould also cover important differential diagnoses such as\nother rickettsial infections and leptospirosis.\n\nChloramphenicol or azithromycin is the accepted alterna-\ntive treatment if tetracyclines are contraindicated, as is the\ncase in pregnant women or patients with tetracycline hyper-\nsensitivity. Children at any age with scrub typhus can be\nsafely treated with doxycycline.\n\nOf note, acute hearing loss or hearing impairment in a\nfebrile patient from Asia should always arouse strong suspi-\ncion of scrub typhus. However, no single clinical sign or lab-\noratory test can rule in or rule out scrub typhus; therefore\nempirical antirickettsial treatment is given based on clinical\nand epidemiological evidence. A definitive laboratory diag-\nnosis — if at all possible in the particular setting — can be\nestablished by demonstration of seroconversion in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples or by PCR on pre-\ntreatment buffy coat samples of an eschar biopsy.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nOn day 2 after admission the patient developed coarse\ntremors of both upper and lower limbs associated with sac-\ncadic oscillations of her eyes in all directions with further\ndeterioration of level of consciousness (GCS 8). At this point\na careful clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated\ncrater-like lesion in the right axilla hidden within the axillary\nfolds. Doxycycline therapy was commenced and the patient\nimproved over the next 48 hours. She was discharged on day\n6 after admission. Her hearing had returned to normal and\nthere were no other neurological deficits.\n\nThe patient’s O. tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre came back\nhigh (>1:4096), supporting the suspected diagnosis of scrub\ntyphus.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nScrub Typhus\n\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of\nAsia and northern Australia. Its epidemiology has long been\nconsidered limited to the Asia-Pacific area but in 2016 was also\nfirst described in patients from South America.\n\nScrub typhus belongs to the tropical rickettsial\ninfections and is caused by O. tsutsugamushi. The infection is\ntransmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a\ntrombiculid mite.\n\nInfected mite larvae are found in a wide variety of habitats,\nfrom scrubs and primary forests to gardens, beaches, bamboo\nfields and oil palm or rubber estates. Reservoirs of O. tsutsu-\ngamushi are rodents and the mites themselves, which can\nmaintain the infection by vertical transmission. Humans are\naccidental hosts.\n\nThe incubation period is 6 to 10 days. A painless papule\noccurs at the site of the bite, which later ulcerates and trans-\nforms into a black crust or ‘eschar’. Patients present with fever,\nsevere headache and myalgia, regional or generalized lymph-\nadenopathy and, at times, a macular or maculopapular rash.\nConjunctival suffusions, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as\nconstipation can occur.\n\nCNS involvement is common in scrub typhus, and\npresentations with diffuse encephalopathy or a reversible sen-\nsorineural deafness are well documented. In contrast, focal\nneurological signs are rare. Cerebellar, brainstem and extrapy-\nramidal manifestations have been reported, including opsoclo-\nnus, myoclonus and parkinsonian tremor. Further complications\ninclude myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS and renal\nfailure. Immunity is short-lived and strain-specific.\n\nDiagnosis can be challenging and, in many resource-limited\nsettings, remains clinical. The diagnostic gold standard is the\ndocumentation of a significant rise in antibody titres in paired\nacute and convalescent serum samples. However, these\nserological tests are usually unavailable in resource-poor\ntropical areas. Despite controversies in sensitivity and speci-\nficity, inmunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests have\nbeen developed for field use and are being used in the diag-\nnosis of scrub typhus in several endemic countries. ELISA-\nbased tests have a high sensitivity and specificity. PCR-based\ntests have been developed and are mostly employed in\ngenotypic characterization and for research purposes or as\ndiagnostic tools in high-resource settings. Culture of O. tsut-\nsugamushi from the blood takes several weeks and requires a\nbiosafety level 3 facility."}}

Foreign body giant cells (white arrows) are also\nseen in the tissue.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nParagonimiasis\n\n \n\n \n\nParagonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by\ninfection with lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Paragonimus\nwestermani is the most widely distributed species in Asia, but\nseveral additional species also cause disease (Table 71.2). Apart\nfrom Asia, paragonimiasis occurs in the Americas and in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n\nAdult flukes live in the lungs of a mammalian host (felines,\ncanines, humans). Ova are coughed up and either expectorated\nor swallowed and passed in the faeces. When eggs reach fresh\nwater, miracidia hatch and infect a snail (first intermediate host).\nAfter asexual multiplication, cercariae are released and infect a\ncrab or crayfish (second intermediate host).\n\nHuman infection occurs mainly via consumption of raw or\nundercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with\nParagonimus metacercariae. In addition, eating raw meat of wild\nboar, which is a paratenic host, is an important route of infection,\nespecially in Japan. Venison (deer meet) has also been proven as\nthe potential source of P. westermani infection in humans.\nBecause the range of paratenic hosts may even be wider, eating\nwild animal meat in general may be a risk factor for this disease.\n\nMetacercariae excyst in the small intestine and penetrate the\nintestinal wall. They pass through the liver and diaphragm, invade\nthe pleural space and finally enter the lung parenchyma where\nthey mature into adults and produce eggs. Juvenile worms\nsometimes migrate into subcutaneous soft tissue or the central\nnervous system to cause unexpected, potentially deleterious\nlesions.\n\nClinical features of the disease are similar to those of pulmo-\nnary TB or lung cancer. Patients may have chronic cough, hae-\nmoptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats and abnormal findings\non chest imaging. Pleural effusion (Fig. 71.2) with marked\neosinophilia in the exudate and pneumothorax without apparent\nnodular lesion/cavitation may occur in the early stages and/or in\nlight infections.\n\nExtrapulmonary paragonimiasis may present as painless,\nmobile subcutaneous swellings. Migration into the CNS may lead\nto acute eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and epilepsy.\n\nHowever, about 20% of patients are asymptomatic and the\ndisease is accidentally found on routine chest radiography, when\nnodules, ring shadows or cavities are typically seen.\n\nEosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection\nbut may be only mild or absent in chronic disease.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum,\nBAL fluid or faeces (Fig. 71.3). However, sensitivity is below 50%\nin light infections. Instead, an immunodiagnostic screening test\nsuch as multiple-dot ELISA (Fig. 71.4) should be used in com-\nbination with the patient’s history and additional laboratory\nresults. Serological tests (e.g. ELISA) may detect early as well as\nchronic infections, and titres decline rapidly after cure. Prazi-\nquantel is the drug of choice. A course of 25mg/kg tds for 3\nconsecutive days is usually effective against all Paragonimus\nspecies.\n\nEven in paragonimiasis-endemic areas, physicians often do not\nPay much attention to this disease and misdiagnose it as pulmo-\nnary tuberculosis or lung cancer. Such diagnostic errors result in\nenormous socioeconomic loss, and create a mental and physical\nburden for the patient because of unnecessary hospitalization and\nlaboratory investigations, surgical interventions and/or long-term\nmedication.

Foreign body giant cells (white arrows) are also\nseen in the tissue.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nParagonimiasis\n\n \n\n \n\nParagonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by\ninfection with lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Paragonimus\nwestermani is the most widely distributed species in Asia, but\nseveral additional species also cause disease (Table 71.2). Apart\nfrom Asia, paragonimiasis occurs in the Americas and in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n\nAdult flukes live in the lungs of a mammalian host (felines,\ncanines, humans). Ova are coughed up and either expectorated\nor swallowed and passed in the faeces. When eggs reach fresh\nwater, miracidia hatch and infect a snail (first intermediate host).\nAfter asexual multiplication, cercariae are released and infect a\ncrab or crayfish (second intermediate host).\n\nHuman infection occurs mainly via consumption of raw or\nundercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with\nParagonimus metacercariae. In addition, eating raw meat of wild\nboar, which is a paratenic host, is an important route of infection,\nespecially in Japan. Venison (deer meet) has also been proven as\nthe potential source of P. westermani infection in humans.\nBecause the range of paratenic hosts may even be wider, eating\nwild animal meat in general may be a risk factor for this disease.\n\nMetacercariae excyst in the small intestine and penetrate the\nintestinal wall. They pass through the liver and diaphragm, invade\nthe pleural space and finally enter the lung parenchyma where\nthey mature into adults and produce eggs. Juvenile worms\nsometimes migrate into subcutaneous soft tissue or the central\nnervous system to cause unexpected, potentially deleterious\nlesions.\n\nClinical features of the disease are similar to those of pulmo-\nnary TB or lung cancer. Patients may have chronic cough, hae-\nmoptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats and abnormal findings\non chest imaging. Pleural effusion (Fig. 71.2) with marked\neosinophilia in the exudate and pneumothorax without apparent\nnodular lesion/cavitation may occur in the early stages and/or in\nlight infections.\n\nExtrapulmonary paragonimiasis may present as painless,\nmobile subcutaneous swellings. Migration into the CNS may lead\nto acute eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and epilepsy.\n\nHowever, about 20% of patients are asymptomatic and the\ndisease is accidentally found on routine chest radiography, when\nnodules, ring shadows or cavities are typically seen.\n\nEosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection\nbut may be only mild or absent in chronic disease.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum,\nBAL fluid or faeces (Fig. 71.3). However, sensitivity is below 50%\nin light infections. Instead, an immunodiagnostic screening test\nsuch as multiple-dot ELISA (Fig. 71.4) should be used in com-\nbination with the patient’s history and additional laboratory\nresults. Serological tests (e.g. ELISA) may detect early as well as\nchronic infections, and titres decline rapidly after cure. Prazi-\nquantel is the drug of choice. A course of 25mg/kg tds for 3\nconsecutive days is usually effective against all Paragonimus\nspecies.\n\nEven in paragonimiasis-endemic areas, physicians often do not\nPay much attention to this disease and misdiagnose it as pulmo-\nnary tuberculosis or lung cancer. Such diagnostic errors result in\nenormous socioeconomic loss, and create a mental and physical\nburden for the patient because of unnecessary hospitalization and\nlaboratory investigations, surgical interventions and/or long-term\nmedication. Figure 71.5 shows a typical example of such a case, in\nwhich postoperative histopathology revealed the presence of\nParagonimus eggs in the resected nodular lesion, which had been\ndiagnosed as a lung cancer by FDG-PET imaging."}}

It is\nuncommon in communities where diet is supplemented by\nanimal protein. Incidence peaks during the rainy season when\nstaple food items and vegetables are in short supply.\n\nHowever, kwashiorkor is not (just) a consequence of a diet\nlow in protein and micronutrients. Infections often precede the\nonset of the disease. They lead to low albumin levels in the\ncontext of acute phase reactions. Diarrhoeal diseases and\ncapillary leakage result in further loss of protein, nutrients and\nfluids. An imbalance between free radicals and insufficient levels\nof antioxidants leads to oxidative stress and damage of cell\nmembranes. Hypoimmunoglobulinaemia leads to severe\ninfections, contributing to the high fatality rates associated with\nkwashiorkor.\n\nThe typical age at presentation is 1 to 3 years; boys and girls\nare equally affected.\n\nHepatomegaly is a common finding. The hair becomes\ndepigmented, fair or reddish in colour and is easy to pluck.\nHyperpigmented, dry, damaged and infected skin may show\npale patches (‘flaky paint’ dermatosis) and ulcerations. Children\nwith kwashiorkor are miserable, apathetic and often refuse\nto eat.\n\nManagement is challenging and involves careful feeding\nwith slowly increasing amounts of feeds with meticulous\nmonitoring of glucose levels, weight gain and fluid status.\nProphylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given to all\npatients, because signs of infection including fever may be\nabsent. Diuretics are contraindicated because they further\ndeplete the intravascular volume, causing hypotension. The\noedema will settle once therapeutic feeding has been\nestablished.\n\nPatients should also receive folic acid, anthelmintics and,\nonce stable, measles vaccination if unvaccinated. Relapses are\ncommon and renal and liver function, as well as glucose levels,\nmay be deranged well beyond the time of clinical recovery.\n\nCase fatality rates from kwashiorkor are high, with a median\nof 20-30%.

It seems to improve\nsurvival, particularly when given during the first 6 days of\nsymptomatic disease, but the quality of studies on this\nare poor.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed with antigen test-\ning and the patient received IV ribavirin in a specialist isola-\ntion unit. Unfortunately, the patient was already very unwell\nby this stage and died 2 days later. All of the patient’s family,\nclose friends and medical staff were interviewed to determine\nwhether they had had contact with the patient. All contacts\nwere advised to monitor their temperature and seek medical\nhelp if they became unwell within 21 days of the contact.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nLassa Fever\n\nLassa fever is a severe systemic disease caused by infection\nwith an arenavirus. It is a zoonosis of rats of the genus Mast-\nomys and infections in humans are likely to result from contact\nwith infected rat urine. Lassa fever is common in Liberia, Sierra\nLeone, Ghana and Nigeria, although it probably occurs in a\nmuch larger area of sub-Saharan West Africa (Fig. 74.1). Cases\nhave been imported to Europe from other countries such as\nMali, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo. There are up to 300000 cases\nestimated a year with 5000 deaths, although the confidence\nlimits of this estimate are likely to be very broad.\n\nMost cases are thought to be mild and patients may not\neven present to a health facility; but in hospitalized patients, the\ncase fatality rate may be as high as 20%.

It is a zoonosis of rats of the genus Mast-\nomys and infections in humans are likely to result from contact\nwith infected rat urine. Lassa fever is common in Liberia, Sierra\nLeone, Ghana and Nigeria, although it probably occurs in a\nmuch larger area of sub-Saharan West Africa (Fig. 74.1). Cases\nhave been imported to Europe from other countries such as\nMali, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo. There are up to 300000 cases\nestimated a year with 5000 deaths, although the confidence\nlimits of this estimate are likely to be very broad.\n\nMost cases are thought to be mild and patients may not\neven present to a health facility; but in hospitalized patients, the\ncase fatality rate may be as high as 20%. Lassa fever is more\nsevere in pregnant women, with a higher case fatality rate in the\nthird trimester. It frequently results in premature labour or\nspontaneous abortion and about 90% of fetuses of women\ninfected with Lassa fever die.\n\nThe incubation period is 3 to 21 days.

In all women of child-bearing\nage, folic acid (5 mg/day) should be added to the regimen.\nAEDs recommended for women of child-bearing age in\nresource-rich settings with low HIV prevalence, such as\nlamotrigine, are not available in sub-Saharan Africa and\nmight have adverse interactions with ARVs, especially prote-\nase inhibitors. In those cases where several AEDs are avail-\nable, the specific drug chosen for epilepsy treatment of a\nwoman of child-bearing age will be a trade-off between the\nhealth of the fetus and that of the mother. Here, one should\nconsider that leaving out a drug because of its possible fetal\ntoxicity, such as valproic acid, and using an enzyme-inducing\ndrug with a better record regarding foetal malformations\ninstead, might lead to a virological failure that would jeopar-\ndize both the mother and the child.\n\nCounselling the patients and their guardians is of para-\nmount importance. An epileptic seizure is a dramatic event.\nIn some African communities, epileptic disorder is still\nattributed to supernatural causes. Patients who have experi-\nenced epileptic seizures might become socially stigmatized.\nPatient-tailored, non-judgemental counselling, taking into\naccount the patient’s perception of the disease, might assist\nin securing the patient’s cooperation. Involving local health\nworkers from the community might help overcome miscon-\nceptions and reduce stigma.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was started on carbamazepine 200 mg bid. Val-\n\nproic acid was initially requested but the patient could not\nafford it.\n\nJC-virus DNA was later detected in the CSF as part of a\nresearch study, further confirming the suspected diagnosis of\nPML. She was commenced on ART and remained on carba-\nmazepine. After 6 months, she remained seizure-free and\ncarbamazepine was stopped. After 1 year of ART, the\npatients CD4 count reached 535 cells/pL and she had\nreturned to work.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\nSeizure Management in HIV\n\nHIV patients are at risk for developing seizures related to HIV-\nassociated neurological diseases and metabolic disturbances.\nThe decision to initiate AEDs in an HIV patient with seizures\ndepends on their aetiology and the duration for which the patient\nremains at risk for seizure activity. If the cause is readily\nreversible, such as hypoglycemia, there is no need to initiate\nantiepileptic treatment. If the patient has a seizure related to a\nreversible process of medium duration such as an opportunistic\ninfection (Ol), it is reasonable to initiate an AED and continue it for\n3 to 6 months after treatment for the Ol has been completed. Ifa\npatient develops persistent seizure activity without a reversible\ncause, then a diagnosis of epilepsy should be given and long-\nterm AED will be required.\n\nIdeally, one should select an AED that avoids hepatic\nmetabolism because of drug—drug interactions with antiretroviral\ntherapy.

In all women of child-bearing\nage, folic acid (5 mg/day) should be added to the regimen.\nAEDs recommended for women of child-bearing age in\nresource-rich settings with low HIV prevalence, such as\nlamotrigine, are not available in sub-Saharan Africa and\nmight have adverse interactions with ARVs, especially prote-\nase inhibitors. In those cases where several AEDs are avail-\nable, the specific drug chosen for epilepsy treatment of a\nwoman of child-bearing age will be a trade-off between the\nhealth of the fetus and that of the mother. Here, one should\nconsider that leaving out a drug because of its possible fetal\ntoxicity, such as valproic acid, and using an enzyme-inducing\ndrug with a better record regarding foetal malformations\ninstead, might lead to a virological failure that would jeopar-\ndize both the mother and the child.\n\nCounselling the patients and their guardians is of para-\nmount importance. An epileptic seizure is a dramatic event.\nIn some African communities, epileptic disorder is still\nattributed to supernatural causes. Patients who have experi-\nenced epileptic seizures might become socially stigmatized.\nPatient-tailored, non-judgemental counselling, taking into\naccount the patient’s perception of the disease, might assist\nin securing the patient’s cooperation. Involving local health\nworkers from the community might help overcome miscon-\nceptions and reduce stigma.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was started on carbamazepine 200 mg bid. Val-\n\nproic acid was initially requested but the patient could not\nafford it.\n\nJC-virus DNA was later detected in the CSF as part of a\nresearch study, further confirming the suspected diagnosis of\nPML. She was commenced on ART and remained on carba-\nmazepine. After 6 months, she remained seizure-free and\ncarbamazepine was stopped. After 1 year of ART, the\npatients CD4 count reached 535 cells/pL and she had\nreturned to work.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nSeizure Management in HIV\n\nHIV patients are at risk for developing seizures related to HIV-\nassociated neurological diseases and metabolic disturbances.\nThe decision to initiate AEDs in an HIV patient with seizures\ndepends on their aetiology and the duration for which the patient\nremains at risk for seizure activity. If the cause is readily\nreversible, such as hypoglycemia, there is no need to initiate\nantiepileptic treatment. If the patient has a seizure related to a\nreversible process of medium duration such as an opportunistic\ninfection (Ol), it is reasonable to initiate an AED and continue it for\n3 to 6 months after treatment for the Ol has been completed. Ifa\npatient develops persistent seizure activity without a reversible\ncause, then a diagnosis of epilepsy should be given and long-\nterm AED will be required.\n\nIdeally, one should select an AED that avoids hepatic\nmetabolism because of drug—drug interactions with antiretroviral\ntherapy. However, this may not be possible in a resource-limited\nsetting where the only available drugs are hepatically"}}

Gold standard of diagnosis is the demonstration\nof trypanosomes in blood smears by microscopy. Why\ntrypanosomes were not identified in the first blood smear\n24 hours after his illness started is not clear — they may not have\nbeen present in sufficient numbers in the blood at that stage\nor they may have been missed by the laboratory technician\nwho was focused on searching for malaria parasites. Suramin\nis the treatment of choice for early stage East African\ntrypanosomiasis (Table 78.1). It needs to be administered\ncarefully with an initial test dose in case of hypersensitivity\nreactions. It is potentially nephrotoxic, hence the need for\nurine monitoring.\n\nIn all cases of trypanosomiasis, it is essential to check the\nCSF for stage determination. It is best to perform the lumbar\npuncture 24 hours after the first dose of suramin to avoid\nintroducing trypanosomes from the blood into the CSF during\nlumbar puncture. If there are >5 cells/pl in the CSF or try-\npanosomes are found, this is considered stage 2 (neurological\ninvolvement). Treatment in case of second stage East African\ntrypanosomiasis is with melarsoprol, a trivalent arsenical drug\nwith severe potential toxic effects (Table 78.1).\n\nFurther Reading\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.\n\nBurri C, Chappus F, Brun R.

Gold standard of diagnosis is the demonstration\nof trypanosomes in blood smears by microscopy. Why\ntrypanosomes were not identified in the first blood smear\n24 hours after his illness started is not clear — they may not have\nbeen present in sufficient numbers in the blood at that stage\nor they may have been missed by the laboratory technician\nwho was focused on searching for malaria parasites. Suramin\nis the treatment of choice for early stage East African\ntrypanosomiasis (Table 78.1). It needs to be administered\ncarefully with an initial test dose in case of hypersensitivity\nreactions. It is potentially nephrotoxic, hence the need for\nurine monitoring.\n\nIn all cases of trypanosomiasis, it is essential to check the\nCSF for stage determination. It is best to perform the lumbar\npuncture 24 hours after the first dose of suramin to avoid\nintroducing trypanosomes from the blood into the CSF during\nlumbar puncture. If there are >5 cells/pl in the CSF or try-\npanosomes are found, this is considered stage 2 (neurological\ninvolvement). Treatment in case of second stage East African\ntrypanosomiasis is with melarsoprol, a trivalent arsenical drug\nwith severe potential toxic effects (Table 78.1).", "Further Reading": "1.\n\nBurri C, Chappus F, Brun R.

Therefore\ndiagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main hel-\nminth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wast-\ning are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis\n(see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal\nprotozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli\nmight cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated\nfrom northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for\nS. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be\nordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae\nof S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann\n\ntechnique should be performed. The latter has the advantage\nof being technically simple and providing results within a few\nhours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and\nurine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWould You Order Any Additional Investigations?\n\nBecause S. stercoralis is the most probable cause of this severe\ndisease, serology for HTLV-1 should be ordered. HTLV-1 is\nan important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syn-\ndrome, and Peru is endemic for this retrovirus. The family\nhistory of the patient also hints at this virus that is commonly\ntransmitted by breastfeeding.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptom-\natic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopa-\nthology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent\nto the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which\ndemonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercor-\nalis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respi-\nratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral\ntreatment with ivermectin (200 jig/kg per day x 7 days)\nwas initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co-\ninfection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered\nfrom diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within\nweeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months\nwas negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and\nwas without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first\ntime in more than 10 years.

It derives\nfrom the Greek word “myia” which means “fly.” Cutaneous\nfuruncular myiasis is one of the most common travel-associated\nskin disorders.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is usually caused by the larvae\nof Cordylobia anthropophaga, also known as Tumbu fly, Mango\nfly or Putzi fly. Adult female flies deposit their eggs on sandy\nground or on damp laundry spread out on the ground or hung on\naclothesline to dry. Normal hosts are dogs and rodents. Humans\nbecome infected when lying on the ground or wearing contami-\nnated clothes without prior hot ironing. Larvae hatch and burrow\ninto the skin. Over the following 2 to 3 weeks the developing\nlarvae cause an itchy and at times painful ‘blind boil.’ Lesions are\nusually sterile because of bacteriostatic substances produced in\nthe larvae’s guts.\n\nTreatment aims to deprive the larvae of oxygen, which\nprompts them to extrude from the skin. This can be achieved by\napplying white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin on the lesion\nto block their respiratory spiracles. Immature larvae are best\nleft to develop for a while because they are difficult to retrieve,\nand maceration of the larva can lead to inflammation and\nsuperinfection. Even untreated, cutaneous myiasis is self-\nlimiting because the mature larva has to leave the host and\npupate elsewhere.\n\nIn Central and South America, myiasis is caused by Derma-\ntobia hominis, the human botfly (Fig. 8.2). Unlike the Tumbu fly,\nthis species lays its eggs directly on exposed skin. Furthermore, it\ndeposits its ova on blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes,\nflies or ticks, which afterwards convey them to the human host, a\ntechnique called ‘hitch-hiking.’\n\nRemoval of botfly larvae can be slightly challenging because of\ntheir shape, and the process may require local anaesthesia and\ncruciate incision.\n\nAdditional forms of myiasis exist whereby larvae may invade\nvarious body cavities such as nasal sinuses, ears, mouth, eye,\nvagina or anus (body cavity myiasis).

After leaving Afghan-\nistan with his wife and two children, the family first lived in a\nrefugee camp in Iran. There, the patient started feeling ill\nabout 6 months ago and was treated with tablets for several\nweeks. Initially he also received intragluteal injections. His\nsymptoms subsided whilst on medication but recurred after\nthe treatment ended. After crossing Turkey and Eastern\nEurope, the family reached Germany 4 months ago. All med-\nical documents were lost during the journey.\n\nClinical Findings\n\nThe patient is afebrile and in fair general condition. Vital\nsigns are normal. On examination, there is marked spinal\ntenderness in the lumbar region. The remaining examination\nis unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory Results and Imaging\n\nDifferential blood count, liver and renal function tests as well\nas LDH are normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sed-\nimentation rate are slightly raised at 26 mg/L (<5 mg/L) and\n40 mm/hour (<20 mm/hour), respectively. Urinalysis is\nunremarkable.\n\nMRI of the spine reveals signal enhancement of the L3\nand L4 vertebral bodies, the corresponding vertebral disc\nand the right psoas muscle, as well as disc space narrowing\nand irregularities of both adjacent vertebral endplates\n(Fig. 81.1A and B).

Which investigations are useful to determine the\ncausative agent?\n\nDiscussion\n\n \n\nA male Afghan refugee presents with a 6-month history of\nrecurrent fever, night sweats and progressive back pain. Phys-\nical examination reveals localized lumbar spinal tenderness.\nCRP and ESR are slightly raised and an MRI of the spine\nshows spondylodiscitis of L3/L4 with involvement of the\npsoas muscle.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat are the Most Likely Differential Diagnoses in\nThis Patient?\n\nSpondylitis in a febrile young adult is likely to be infectious.\nGlobally, tuberculosis is the main cause of infectious spon-\ndylitis.

There, the patient started feeling ill\nabout 6 months ago and was treated with tablets for several\nweeks. Initially he also received intragluteal injections. His\nsymptoms subsided whilst on medication but recurred after\nthe treatment ended. After crossing Turkey and Eastern\nEurope, the family reached Germany 4 months ago.

On examination, there is marked spinal\ntenderness in the lumbar region. The remaining examination\nis unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory Results and Imaging\n\nDifferential blood count, liver and renal function tests as well\nas LDH are normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sed-\nimentation rate are slightly raised at 26 mg/L (<5 mg/L) and\n40 mm/hour (<20 mm/hour), respectively. Urinalysis is\nunremarkable.\n\nMRI of the spine reveals signal enhancement of the L3\nand L4 vertebral bodies, the corresponding vertebral disc\nand the right psoas muscle, as well as disc space narrowing\nand irregularities of both adjacent vertebral endplates\n(Fig. 81.1A and B).

The cycle is completed\nwhen a carnivorous mammal eats the second intermediate\nhost.\n\nHumans can become infected by ingesting the first or sec-\nond intermediate host, i.e. by drinking water containing\ninfected copepods, eating undercooked meat from infected\nsnakes, frogs, or birds, or by the use of poultices produced\nfrom infested frog or snake flesh or skin on open wounds\nor eyes.\n\nIn the human body, the sparganum commonly migrates\ninto subcutaneous tissue or muscle, and sometimes into the\neye, the spinal cord or brain, the latter resulting in cerebral\nsparganosis.

She has a widespread non-blanching\npurpuric rash.\n\nAnswer to Question 1\n\nWhat is the Differential Diagnosis and What\nEmpirical Treatment Would You Give?\n\nThe patient presented at the rural district hospital with fever\nand malaise and developed confusion. There is malaria in\nrural Vietnam and both P. falciparum and P. vivax are\nendemic; therefore severe malaria must be excluded. Enteric\nfever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries,\ncan cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of\ndisease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue\nfever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be con-\nsidered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with tran-\nsient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse\nerythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small propor-\ntion of patients develop severe disease during a second,\nimmune-mediated phase (usually on day 4-6). This phase\nmay be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous\nbleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as\nencephalitis.\n\nIn this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningi-\ntis and shock is not typical for dengue.\n\nMelioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider.\nIn some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause\n\nxt: Gey Noe =taenstom A 55-Year-Old Female Pig Farmer from Vietnam With Fever and Impaired Consciousness\n\nof community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a\nrisk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain\nabscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is compara-\ntively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease\nremains to be elucidated.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis though seems to be acute bac-\nterial meningitis complicated by septic shock. Globally, the\ncommon causes of acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus\npneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influen-\nzae. Both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis infections can\nbe complicated by development of a purpuric rash; this is\nmore common with NV. meningitidis septicemia.\n\nIn Vietnam, however, the commonest identified cause of\nacute bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus suis. Like\nits counterparts, S. swis infection can cause both meningitis\nand septic shock; the syndromes overlap. A florid purpuric\nrash is common (6%-31% of patient cases).\n\nOther forms of meningitis seen in Asia and the tropics\ninclude tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. Although\neach of these tends to have a more insidious onset, the dura-\ntion of symptoms before presentation can be as short as 4 to\n5 days; these diagnoses therefore should always be considered.\nHowever, they are not associated with shock or purpuric rash.\n\nMeningitis is a medical emergency requiring prompt\ntreatment. Lumbar puncture is the investigation of choice\nbut should not delay administration of broad-spectrum\nintravenous antibiotics. A typical choice is ceftriaxone; where\nresistance is suspected or common epidemiologically, vanco-\nmycin is also administered. The value of adjunctive cortico-\nsteroids in acute bacterial meningitis is difficult to generalize.\nLarge studies in Africa found no benefit; this contrasts with\n‘Western Europe, where steroids reduced the risk of death,\nand Vietnam, where in microbiologically confirmed disease\nthey reduced the risk of complications.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWhat Additional Investigations are Needed?\n\nThe patient requires a lumbar puncture and blood cultures.\nCSF should be sent for microscopy, Gram stain, cell count,\nprotein, glucose and culture. A simultaneous blood glucose\nmeasurement should be performed. If resources are limited,\nthen CSF glucose with simultaneous blood glucose is the\nmost important test informing clinical management, because\nanormal ratio (i.e. a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.6) excludes\nacute bacterial meningitis and TB. In both bacterial and Tb\nmeningitis, the CSF/serum glucose ratio is expected to be\nmarkedly diminished. Rapid diagnostic tests such as pneu-\nmococcal antigen can be performed on CSF, blood or urine,\nand meningococcal polymerase chain reaction on blood or\nCSF if available. Because the patient is from a malaria-\nendemic area, the blood film should be repeated.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nThe patient received empirical treatment with intravenous\nceftriaxone and vancomycin, and supportive treatment\nincluding intravenous fluids.

The disease is also still endemic in parts of West and\nCentral Africa. Yaws is normally seen in young children; it is\nassociated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The disease\nconsists of primary, secondary and tertiary phases. The primary\nlesion usually starts as a localized papule 2 to 10 weeks after\ninoculation. Common sites are the lower legs and the face. The\npapule may develop into a large nodule 2 to 5 cm in diameter\n\n \n\nthat ulcerates.

Late-stage disease is characterized by\ndestructive lesions of soft tissues and bones.

The first case was\nreported in China in 2009; and since then, cases have been\nreported in both Japan and Korea. As of 2019, 491 cases had\nbeen reported in Japan from when the first case was reported\nin 2012.\n\nThe SFTS virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, which also\nincludes the Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and\nhantavirus. Its incubation period is 6 to 14 days. Despite being\na tick-borne disease, it is reported that an eschar is rarely seen.\nClinical manifestations of SFTS include fever, nausea, diarrhoea,\narthralgia, myalgia and neurological symptoms. Laboratory\nresults typically show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and ele-\nvated serum AST, ALT, LDH and CK levels.

Ultrasound scans confirm the presence\nof moderate bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, as well as\nmild hepatomegaly and a thickened gallbladder wall. He is\ninfused with Ringer’s lactate solution at a volume of\n10mL/kg over 1 hour before his fluid status is reassessed.\nHe remains tachycardic and oliguric with a haematocrit rise\nto 55.1%, therefore the rate of fluid therapy is increased to\n15mL/kg/hr until sufficient haemodynamic improvement is\nshown. The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to\n7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every\n2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments\nare undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with hae-\nmatocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged\nfrom hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery. Reverse\ntranscriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA\nconfirm dengue diagnosis.\n\nSUMMARY BOX\n\n \n\nDengue\n\nDengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect\nhumans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million\ninfections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus\nfamily and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct\nserotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-\ntoes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes\nalbopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive\ntemperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in\nEurope and North America. Although most clinically apparent\ninfections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority\n\n \n\nprogress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding,\ncapillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually\nprogresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’\nduration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia,\nthrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk\nof capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of\ndefervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical\nimprovement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption\nand organ recovery.\n\nDengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness\nby detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection\nof viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these\nmethods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral\nblood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed,\n(at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however,\ncross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, espe-\ncially in Zika endemic areas.\n\nWarning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or\ntenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal\nbleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increas-\ning haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytope-\nnia, six of which were present in this case. With no antiviral\ntreatment available, cautious intravascular volume replacement\nand supportive treatment are the mainstays of management,\naccompanied by careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. In\nmany countries the epidemiology of dengue is changing in line\nwith aging populations. Older patients often present with atypical\nfeatures and have higher risk of complications and death as a\nresult of difficulties in controlling haemodynamic status in the\ncontext of high-level comorbidity. Uncontrolled hypertension\nand diabetes, as in this case, have been shown to be risk factors\nfor poor outcomes. Promising attempts at vaccine deployment\nhave been thwarted by the fact that re-infection of immune-\nprimed individuals is associated with greater risk of severe dis-\nease; therefore the searches for effective therapeutics and a\npan-specific dengue vaccine continue.\n\n \n\n \n\nFurther reading\n\n \n\n.

He is\ninfused with Ringer’s lactate solution at a volume of\n10mL/kg over 1 hour before his fluid status is reassessed.\nHe remains tachycardic and oliguric with a haematocrit rise\nto 55.1%, therefore the rate of fluid therapy is increased to\n15mL/kg/hr until sufficient haemodynamic improvement is\nshown. The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to\n7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every\n2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments\nare undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with hae-\nmatocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged\nfrom hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery. Reverse\ntranscriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA\nconfirm dengue diagnosis.\n\n\nSUMMARY BOX\nDengue\n\nDengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect\nhumans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million\ninfections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus\nfamily and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct\nserotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosqui-\ntoes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes\nalbopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive\ntemperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in\nEurope and North America. Although most clinically apparent\ninfections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority\n\n \n\nprogress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding,\ncapillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually\nprogresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days’\nduration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia,\nthrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk\nof capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of\ndefervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical\nimprovement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption\nand organ recovery.\n\nDengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness\nby detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection\nof viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these\nmethods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral\nblood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed,\n(at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however,\ncross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, espe-\ncially in Zika endemic areas.\n\nWarning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or\ntenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal\nbleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increas-\ning haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytope-\nnia, six of which were present in this case. With no antiviral\ntreatment available, cautious intravascular volume replacement\nand supportive treatment are the mainstays of management,\naccompanied by careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. In\nmany countries the epidemiology of dengue is changing in line\nwith aging populations. Older patients often present with atypical\nfeatures and have higher risk of complications and death as a\nresult of difficulties in controlling haemodynamic status in the\ncontext of high-level comorbidity. Uncontrolled hypertension\nand diabetes, as in this case, have been shown to be risk factors\nfor poor outcomes. Promising attempts at vaccine deployment\nhave been thwarted by the fact that re-infection of immune-\nprimed individuals is associated with greater risk of severe dis-\nease; therefore the searches for effective therapeutics and a\npan-specific dengue vaccine continue.\n\n\nFurther reading\n.

Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile trav-\neller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocyto-\npenia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays\nrarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however,\noverlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic\ntest (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are\nof unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum\nmalaria. Also, in falciparum malaria high parasitaemia may\ncause a prozone phenomenon with a false negative RDT.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Do You Proceed?\n\nTo reliably rule out dengue and indeed any of the arboviral\ninfections, serology at this point is the diagnostic test of\nchoice, because viraemia is short and IgM should be positive\nby day 6 of fever. Convalescent samples taken 10 to 14 days\nlater should show a further rise in titres.\n\nFor diagnosis of influenza a deep nasopharyngeal swab\nshould be obtained, and care must be taken to apply the cor-\nrect technique. For acute HIV infection fourth-generation\ndiagnostic tests which include p24 antigen, should be able\nto diagnose acute infection. Western Blot may still be nega-\ntive at this stage, but in case of doubt, HIV PCR would help\nestablish the diagnosis. Blood cultures would be the appro-\npriate test to rule out enteric fever.\n\nFor malaria, microscopy (thick and thin films) remains\nthe diagnostic gold standard. Three negative films taken\non consecutive days are considered to safely rule out malaria.\n\nIf malaria parasites are detected but the species remains\nunclear even at a referral laboratory, species-specific polymer-\nase chain reaction (PCR) may be useful.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nA thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites\nat a density of 920/pL. On thin film however, the microsco-\npist on duty was unable to determine the Plasmodium spe-\ncies. Based on the negative result of the rapid diagnostic\ntest, non-falciparum malaria was suspected. The patient\nwas admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment\nwas started with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets\nonce daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was\ndischarged on the fourth day. For further parasite differenti-\nation, malaria microscopy was repeated by the head parasitol-\nogist.

Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile trav-\neller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocyto-\npenia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays\nrarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however,\noverlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic\ntest (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are\nof unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum\nmalaria. Also, in falciparum malaria high parasitaemia may\ncause a prozone phenomenon with a false negative RDT.\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nHow Do You Proceed?\n\nTo reliably rule out dengue and indeed any of the arboviral\ninfections, serology at this point is the diagnostic test of\nchoice, because viraemia is short and IgM should be positive\nby day 6 of fever. Convalescent samples taken 10 to 14 days\nlater should show a further rise in titres.\n\nFor diagnosis of influenza a deep nasopharyngeal swab\nshould be obtained, and care must be taken to apply the cor-\nrect technique. For acute HIV infection fourth-generation\ndiagnostic tests which include p24 antigen, should be able\nto diagnose acute infection. Western Blot may still be nega-\ntive at this stage, but in case of doubt, HIV PCR would help\nestablish the diagnosis. Blood cultures would be the appro-\npriate test to rule out enteric fever.\n\nFor malaria, microscopy (thick and thin films) remains\nthe diagnostic gold standard. Three negative films taken\non consecutive days are considered to safely rule out malaria.\n\nIf malaria parasites are detected but the species remains\nunclear even at a referral laboratory, species-specific polymer-\nase chain reaction (PCR) may be useful.\n\nThe Case Continued...\n\nA thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites\nat a density of 920/pL. On thin film however, the microsco-\npist on duty was unable to determine the Plasmodium spe-\ncies. Based on the negative result of the rapid diagnostic\ntest, non-falciparum malaria was suspected. The patient\nwas admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment\nwas started with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets\nonce daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was\ndischarged on the fourth day. For further parasite differenti-\nation, malaria microscopy was repeated by the head parasitol-\nogist. After intense reading of the Giemsa-stained thin blood\nfilm, 2 parasite-infected erythrocytes were identified with\nmorphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium\nmalariae or P. knowlesi infection (Figs. 92.1 and 92.2).

It occurs in the rain forests of Central and\nWest Africa. The virus was first identified in 1958 in laboratory\nmonkeys. Human monkeypox was not recognized as a distinct\ninfection in humans until 1970. Then, during efforts to eradicate\nsmallpox, the virus was isolated from a patient with suspected\nsmallpox infection in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo). Although the natural animal reservoir of monkeypox\nremains unknown, several lines of evidence point to rodents as a\nlikely reservoir. The sporadically observed human cases and small\noutbreaks are confined to remote villages and believed to result\nfrom close contact between humans and wild animals. However,\n\n \n\nthe precise exposure is often difficult to pinpoint in areas where\ncontact with animals through household rodent infestations and\nhunting or preparation of bushmeat from a variety of species is\ncommon. Outside endemic areas, there was an outbreak of\nmonkeypox in the United States in 2003 associated with infected\nprairie dogs sold as pets.\n\nAlthough considerably less infective than smallpox, monkey-\nPox can also spread from human to human through the respi-\nratory route or by contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids.\nTransmission is believed to occur through saliva and respiratory\nsecretions or contact with exudate or crust material from the skin\nlesions. Risk factors for transmission include sharing a bed or\nroom or using the same utensils as an infected person.\n\nThe clinical picture of monkeypox is similar to smallpox but\nshows a considerably milder course with a case fatality rate of\n<10%. It is believed that the rising number of reported human\ncases in recent years is largely attributable to the waning herd\nimmunity after the suspension of smallpox vaccination in the\nearly 1980s.\n\nIn endemic regions, the fairly distinct rash of monkeypox is\nprimarily a clinical diagnosis because neither commercial assays\nnor the required laboratory infrastructure are usually readily\navailable. The definitive diagnosis is established by PCR, culture,\nimmunohistochemistry or electron microscopy but demands\nbiosafety level 2 laboratory facilities. Optimal diagnostic speci-\nmens for PCR are lesion exudate on a swab or crust specimens\n(stored in a dry, sterile tube without any transport media and kept\ncold).
