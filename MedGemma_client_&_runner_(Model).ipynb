Initial laboratory evaluation revealed profound thrombocytopenia (25×10^9/L) and leukopenia (1.24×10^9/L). His condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to progressive multiorgan failure with severe metabolic acidosis, acute liver and kidney injury, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Neurological involvement was prominent, with altered mental status, nuchal rigidity, and a declining Glasgow Coma Scale score.

            "**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old Malawian woman diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV 5 months prior to presentation. At that time, her baseline CD4 count was 54/µL. She is currently taking antituberculous therapy, vitamin B6, antiretroviral therapy, and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a 3-month period.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's problems began approximately 3 months earlier with a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed insidiously, and over the following weeks, her left arm also became affected. She is noted to be a poor historian. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment, or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in an urban high-density area in Malawi and works as a street vendor. She is divorced and has no children. No specific exposures to animals, water, or sick contacts are mentioned.\n",
            "**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination is normal except for slightly pale conjunctivae. Fundoscopy is normal with no signs of papilloedema or retinitis. Neurological examination reveals a spastic hemiparesis on the left with hyperreflexia. Power is 2/5 in the left leg and 3/5 in the left arm, with a pronator drift on the left. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: A full blood count showed a WBC of 3.8 x 10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelets of 140 x 10⁹/L. Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for focal brain lesions in this HIV-positive patient included cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CNS tuberculosis. The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's existing antiretroviral, antituberculous, and co-trimoxazole therapies were continued. She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient experienced fever for four days, which was followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg. The weakness subsequently progressed to involve all four limbs over the next two days, resulting in a rapidly progressive quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, from southern India (a rabies-endemic country), reported a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb one month before his symptoms began.

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood investigations, including serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a protein level of 52 mg/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and a pleocytosis of 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes). A saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR, while a CSF sample was negative for the virus.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: A high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies was maintained due to the dog bite history and presentation. Clinical mimics considered included Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and post-vaccination encephalomyelitis. However, features such as fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, and significant CSF pleocytosis helped differentiate this case from GBS.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: After admission, the patient's condition worsened, developing autonomic instability with increased perspiration and variable heart rate and blood pressure. He progressed to dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day of hospitalization. His management was supportive. The patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days after the onset of his symptoms.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is paralytic rabies. This is based on the classic history of a WHO category III dog bite one month prior in a rabies-endemic area, followed by a clinical presentation of fever and rapidly progressive, ascending flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR in a saliva sample. The failure to administer rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) after the severe exposure was a critical lapse in post-exposure prophylaxis, which likely led to the development of the fatal disease despite vaccination.\n",

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a rash on his neck that began as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before its onset while shaving. He had been seen in a clinic 24 hours prior and was discharged on an oral cephalosporin, but returned due to worsening malaise, neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a postal worker in the United States with no recent foreign travel, contact with animals, or known insect bites. The case occurred during an investigation into a bioterrorism event, and his exposure was later determined to be from handling contaminated mail during his occupation.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His neck circumference had increased from a baseline of 57 cm to a peak of 81 cm.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed a 2 cm irregularly shaped, indurated, non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema which made lymph node assessment difficult. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, were normal except for a mildly elevated hemoglobin at 18.7 g/dL. Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. A subsequent Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion were negative for B. anthracis. However, a skin biopsy sent to a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed the presence of B. anthracis antigens. Convalescent serology revealed the presence of antibodies to protective antigen.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for an ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. Given the ongoing bioterrorism investigation in the United States at the time, cutaneous anthrax was the most important diagnosis to consider, supported by the presence of a painless papule evolving into an ulcer with extensive, non-tender edema and systemic symptoms without significant fever.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with a first-generation cephalosporin but his condition worsened. Upon his return to the clinic, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam. Following this treatment regimen, the patient recovered.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a skin biopsy which showed abundant B. anthracis antigens, and by serology showing antibodies to protective antigen in convalescent serum.

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Arterial blood gas on ambient air showed respiratory failure with a PaO2 of 7.6 kPa. The full blood count, creatinine, urea, and liver function tests were normal. CRP was slightly elevated at 6.7 mg/dL. His CD4 count was 150/µL, and his HIV viral load was 1,500,000 copies/mL. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral perihilar infiltrates, and a chest CT showed extensive 'ground-glass' infiltrates with no pulmonary emboli. Serum β-D-glucan was >500 pg/mL. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with Grocott staining revealing Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms and a strongly positive PCR for P. jirovecii DNA.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the patient was ART-naïve and HIV-positive with a low CD4 count, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the leading differential. Other possibilities considered included tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis, particularly in light of his extensive travel. Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n",

Her CD4 count upon starting ART was 320 cells/µL. She had completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 months prior.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Abrupt onset of high fever, confusion, and convulsions.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was reported to be well at 8 a.m., but became confused by 10 a.m. and was then drowsy with a high fever and convulsions upon admission to a central hospital at 11 a.m., indicating a very rapid clinical deterioration over just a few hours.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a primary school teacher residing in Malawi. The text notes that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in adults in Africa. There is no mention of specific travel, animal, or other environmental exposures.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, her temperature was 40°C (104°F), pulse was 125 bpm, blood pressure was 125/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was restless and agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10/15. Physical examination revealed a stiff neck, a positive Kernig's sign, photophobia with equal and reactive pupils, and down-going plantar responses. No rash was present. Chest and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. During the physical examination, she suffered a renewed seizure.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 10.5 x10^9/L (neutrophils 8.9 x10^9/L), haemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and normal platelets. A rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum was negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared hazy. CSF analysis showed 35 leukocytes/µL (60% neutrophils), a high protein of 2.6 g/L, and a low glucose of 1.2 mmol/L. The CSF culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were acute bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and cryptococcal meningitis (CCM). Acute bacterial meningitis was deemed most likely due to the hyperacute presentation. TBM was considered less likely due to the patient's recent completion of TB therapy and the rapid onset, while CCM was less likely because her CD4 count was too high and it typically presents more sub-acutely.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: In the emergency department, the patient received ceftriaxone 2g IV for the suspected meningitis, along with 10mg of diazepam IV and 600mg of phenobarbitone IV for seizure control. She completed a 10-day course of IV ceftriaxone. The patient recovered consciousness by day 3, and anticonvulsants were weaned. She developed a minor hearing loss in her right ear but had no other neurological impairment or seizures upon recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was definitively confirmed by a positive CSF culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, altered consciousness, and signs of meningeal irritation (stiff neck, Kernig's sign), combined with classic CSF findings of a neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose. Other causes like tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis were clinically less likely.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\n",

Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness. The patient's positive response to albendazole therapy further supports the diagnosis.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: A localized, itchy swelling on the left leg that has been slowly developing over three weeks.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: A 26-year-old female presents with a localized swelling on her left leg that developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. The lesion is reported to be itchy but not painful. She has no history of fever or recalled arthropod bites and feels well systemically.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had just returned from a 6-week backpacking trip to Ghana. In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is often caused by the Tumbu fly, which lays eggs on damp laundry or sandy ground. Humans can become hosts by wearing contaminated clothing that has not been hot-ironed or by lying on contaminated ground.\n",
            "**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile at the time of examination. No other vital signs were reported.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: On the left leg, there was a localized swelling approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, covered by a blackish scab. The surrounding skin was slightly hyperaemic. There was no associated lymphadenopathy, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: No laboratory or imaging studies were performed. Diagnosis was made clinically after the scab was removed, revealing a whitish, pulsating matter underneath that was oozing transparent fluid. Under a magnifying glass, this was identified as the pulsating end of a larva, containing respiratory spiracles, which is typical for myiasis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included rickettsial disease and cutaneous anthrax, which were deemed unlikely due to the absence of systemic symptoms. A spider bite was also considered but made less probable by the slow growth over weeks. Localized bacterial infections like furuncles were a possibility given the travel history, but the most likely diagnosis was myiasis (infestation with fly maggots) based on the slow growth, lack of systemic signs, and localized itch.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The lesion was managed by occluding the larva's respiratory spiracles to deprive it of oxygen. The area was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned two days later, at which point the maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with forceps. The remaining lesion appeared clean, and no further treatment was necessary. The condition is noted to be self-limiting as the mature larva eventually leaves the host.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga. The diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical presentation of a slowly growing, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and definitively established by the direct visualization of the pulsating larva with its respiratory spiracles after removal of the scab, followed by its successful extraction. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial infection or spider bite were excluded based on the lesion's slow, non-painful evolution and the absence of systemic symptoms.\n",

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India. He had a history of a dog bite one month prior to symptom onset, for which he received five doses of purified chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Admission to hospital for fever and quadriparesis.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient experienced fever for four days, which was followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg. The weakness subsequently progressed to involve all four limbs over the next two days, resulting in a rapidly progressive quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, from southern India (a rabies-endemic country), reported a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb one month before his symptoms began. He received a full course of five anti-rabies vaccine doses but did not receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as part of his post-exposure prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was conscious with normal mental functions (GCS 15/15). The neurological examination revealed a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis.\n",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a protein level of 52 mg/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and a pleocytosis of 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes). A saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR, while a CSF sample was negative for the virus.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: A high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies was maintained due to the dog bite history and presentation. Clinical mimics considered included Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and post-vaccination encephalomyelitis. However, features such as fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, and significant CSF pleocytosis helped differentiate this case from GBS.\n",

He progressed to dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day of hospitalization. His management was supportive. The patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days after the onset of his symptoms.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is paralytic rabies. This is based on the classic history of a WHO category III dog bite one month prior in a rabies-endemic area, followed by a clinical presentation of fever and rapidly progressive, ascending flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR in a saliva sample.

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness.

            "**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n",
            "**Vitals**: None\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman who lives in a crowded back room within a remote community. Her family noted she had become increasingly withdrawn and was not leaving the house.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old HIV-positive man, diagnosed 6 years prior, who is not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. His CD4 count one month before presentation was 280/μL, and on admission was 150/µL. He denies recreational drug use and has never smoked tobacco, with no other significant past medical history.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath, dry cough, and drenching night sweats.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10 kg over the past 5 months. At presentation, he was short of breath at rest but able to complete full sentences.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in London and travels extensively for business, with work trips in the past 6 months to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. He lives with his male partner. No other specific exposures were mentioned.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation (sO2) of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of O2.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert but short of breath at rest. Auscultation of the chest was clear. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Arterial blood gas on ambient air showed respiratory failure with a PaO2 of 7.6 kPa. The full blood count, creatinine, urea, and liver function tests were normal. CRP was slightly elevated at 6.7 mg/dL. His CD4 count was 150/µL, and his HIV viral load was 1,500,000 copies/mL. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral perihilar infiltrates, and a chest CT showed extensive 'ground-glass' infiltrates with no pulmonary emboli. Serum β-D-glucan was >500 pg/mL. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with Grocott staining revealing Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms and a strongly positive PCR for P. jirovecii DNA.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the patient was ART-naïve and HIV-positive with a low CD4 count, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the leading differential. Other possibilities considered included tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis, particularly in light of his extensive travel. Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n",

Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: Four days after returning from her trip, the patient developed a generalized, slightly pruritic maculopapular rash on her face, trunk, and extremities. There was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. The following day, the rash worsened and she developed non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. She presented to the outpatient department six days after her return.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting to medical care 6 days after her return. The incubation period is consistent with an arboviral infection acquired in Central America.\n",

Additionally, there was tender edema of the hands, elbows, knees, and feet, along with generalized lymphadenopathy affecting the cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a normal full blood count and liver function tests. CRP was slightly elevated at 8 mg/L and creatinine was very mildly elevated at 87 µmol/L. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and chikungunya were negative. Subsequent testing at a reference laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection by a positive RT-PCR on an initial blood sample. Paired serology showed seroconversion, with a Zika IgM titer of 1:640 and a significant rise in Zika IgG from 1:20 to 1:5120. A rise in Dengue IgG was also noted but interpreted as cross-reactivity.\n",

            "**Final Diagnosis**: Acute Zika virus infection was diagnosed. The confirmation was based on a positive Zika virus RT-PCR from a blood sample taken 6 days after symptom onset. The diagnosis was further supported by seroconversion in paired serum samples, which demonstrated a positive Zika IgM and a significant rise in Zika IgG titer. Dengue and chikungunya were ruled out by negative tests, and the rise in Dengue IgG was attributed to serological cross-reactivity common among flaviviruses.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a single episode of 'pins and needles' sensations that started on the right side of her face, marched to her right arm, and then involved her right leg, lasting for about 2 minutes. This was consistent with a Jacksonian 'sensory march' or focal epileptic seizure. A similar episode had occurred several months prior, for which she did not seek medical attention.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Four years prior to presentation, the patient completed a 2-year backpacking trip through endemic regions in South America (Ecuador, Peru, Argentina) and South-east Asia (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia). During her travels, she stayed in hostels and with local people in the countryside. Her diet consisted of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and rice from local vendors, with no animal products.

An MRI of the brain with gadolinium enhancement revealed multiple cortical and subcortical cystic lesions in both hemispheres, some containing a scolex ('central dot'). Some lesions showed perifocal edema and ring-enhancement. The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) for anticysticercal antibodies in both serum and CSF.\n",

This was based on the combination of a focal epileptic seizure, extensive travel history to endemic areas in South America and Asia, and characteristic neuroimaging findings of multiple cystic brain lesions in various stages (vesicular and colloidal), despite a normal physical exam and lack of systemic inflammation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days and started on antiepileptic drugs. She declined adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. She remained seizure-free for over a year. A follow-up MRI at 1 year showed regression of all cysts, and a CT scan at 2 years showed two calcifications. Her antiepileptic medication was stopped after a seizure-free period of 3 years.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium.

Twenty-four hours later, he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He was seen at a clinic where a malaria blood film was negative and was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash and subsequently became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, an expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months, was walking in the countryside two days before his illness began.

            "**Physical Exam**: On initial examination, the patient was clammy, in a state of collapse, with a widespread urticarial rash, respiratory distress, and stridor. Chest auscultation revealed expiratory wheezes. A painless, indurated, circumscribed swelling was noted on the inside of his left ankle. On day 3 of admission, the urticaria, stridor, and wheezing resolved, replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash, a slightly puffy face, and a bad headache.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 17.4 d/dL, a white cell count of 6.1 G/L (85% polymorphs), and an ESR of 5 mm/hour. A blood film for malaria parasites, chest radiograph, and stool and urine microscopy were all negative. On day 3, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. A lumbar puncture performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was anaphylactic shock, presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (like acute schistosomiasis), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease, though the absence of eosinophilia was noted. After the clinical picture changed on day 3, with fever, headache, and a new rash, trypanosomiasis was suspected.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated for anaphylactic shock with intramuscular adrenaline, with good effect. He was admitted and received intermittent IM adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistamines for two days. After the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was confirmed on day 3, he was treated with a full course of suramin, totaling 5.75g, starting with a test dose. His urine was monitored weekly during treatment and showed transient protein, casts, and white cells, which resolved after treatment finished.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis, likely caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. Although the initial presentation was an atypical anaphylactic shock, the subsequent development of fever, headache, an erythematous rash, and the recognition of a trypanosomal chancre at the bite site led to the correct diagnosis. The key epidemiological link was the exposure to tsetse fly bites in a game park two weeks prior. The infection was determined to be first-stage as the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\n",

On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord.

Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status.

Neurological examination reveals a spastic hemiparesis on the left with hyperreflexia. Power is 2/5 in the left leg and 3/5 in the left arm, with a pronator drift on the left. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: A full blood count showed a WBC of 3.8 x 10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelets of 140 x 10⁹/L. Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for focal brain lesions in this HIV-positive patient included cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CNS tuberculosis. The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's existing antiretroviral, antituberculous, and co-trimoxazole therapies were continued. She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l.

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was chronic meningitis, with cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculous meningitis being the most important considerations. Partially treated bacterial meningitis was considered less likely due to the gradual onset of symptoms. Malaria was deemed an unlikely diagnosis due to the absence of fever, a negative RDT, prior antimalarial treatment, and the presence of a cranial nerve palsy, which is not typical for malaria.\n",

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for a focal brain lesion in an HIV patient with a new-onset seizure included tuberculoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess, primary CNS lymphoma, and neurocysticercosis. The imaging findings of lesions selectively affecting the white matter without contrast enhancement or perifocal oedema were considered strongly suggestive of PML.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was started on carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily for seizure prevention and was commenced on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Subsequently, JC-virus DNA was detected in the CSF, confirming the diagnosis. After 6 months, she was seizure-free and carbamazepine was stopped. One year after starting ART, her CD4 count had recovered to 535 cells/μL and she had returned to work.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus. The diagnosis was made in the context of a new-onset seizure in a patient with advanced HIV and immunosuppression (CD4 count 153). Brain CT findings of non-enhancing hypodense white matter lesions were highly suggestive, and the diagnosis was later confirmed by the detection of JC-virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's significant clinical improvement and immune recovery after starting antiretroviral therapy further support this diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi with no history of trauma or past tuberculosis. His HIV status was initially unknown but he was later found to be HIV-positive. He is a non-smoker but drinks about one litre of a locally brewed beer daily. He is married with three children who are all well.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi with no history of trauma or past tuberculosis. His HIV status was initially unknown but he was later found to be HIV-positive. He is a non-smoker but drinks about one litre of a locally brewed beer daily. He is married with three children who are all well.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 25-year-old woman from Bani Suwaif in Upper Egypt. No pre-existing comorbidities were reported.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Severe diarrhoea for 2 months accompanied by significant weight loss (15 kg) and amenorrhoea.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness. The patient's positive response to albendazole therapy further supports the diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India. He had a history of a dog bite one month prior to symptom onset, for which he received five doses of purified chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Admission to hospital for fever and quadriparesis.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient experienced fever for four days, which was followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg. The weakness subsequently progressed to involve all four limbs over the next two days, resulting in a rapidly progressive quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, from southern India (a rabies-endemic country), reported a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb one month before his symptoms began. He received a full course of five anti-rabies vaccine doses but did not receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as part of his post-exposure prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was conscious with normal mental functions (GCS 15/15). The neurological examination revealed a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood investigations, including serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a protein level of 52 mg/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and a pleocytosis of 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes). A saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR, while a CSF sample was negative for the virus.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: A high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies was maintained due to the dog bite history and presentation. Clinical mimics considered included Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and post-vaccination encephalomyelitis. However, features such as fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, and significant CSF pleocytosis helped differentiate this case from GBS.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: After admission, the patient's condition worsened, developing autonomic instability with increased perspiration and variable heart rate and blood pressure. He progressed to dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day of hospitalization. His management was supportive. The patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days after the onset of his symptoms.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is paralytic rabies. This is based on the classic history of a WHO category III dog bite one month prior in a rabies-endemic area, followed by a clinical presentation of fever and rapidly progressive, ascending flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR in a saliva sample. The failure to administer rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) after the severe exposure was a critical lapse in post-exposure prophylaxis, which likely led to the development of the fatal disease despite vaccination.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared well. Her neurological examination was completely unremarkable, and the rest of her physical examination was also normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Routine blood investigations, including differential blood count and C-reactive protein, were normal. The CSF examination was also unremarkable. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium enhancement revealed multiple cortical and subcortical cystic lesions in both hemispheres, some containing a scolex ('central dot'). Some lesions showed perifocal edema and ring-enhancement. The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) for anticysticercal antibodies in both serum and CSF.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was neurocysticercosis. This was based on the combination of a focal epileptic seizure, extensive travel history to endemic areas in South America and Asia, and characteristic neuroimaging findings of multiple cystic brain lesions in various stages (vesicular and colloidal), despite a normal physical exam and lack of systemic inflammation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days and started on antiepileptic drugs. She declined adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. She remained seizure-free for over a year. A follow-up MRI at 1 year showed regression of all cysts, and a CT scan at 2 years showed two calcifications. Her antiepileptic medication was stopped after a seizure-free period of 3 years.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a focal seizure, characteristic MRI findings of multiple cystic cerebral lesions, and an epidemiological link through extensive travel in endemic regions. It was definitively confirmed by positive serology (EITB) in both serum and CSF.\n",

Subsequently, JC-virus DNA was detected in the CSF, confirming the diagnosis. After 6 months, she was seizure-free and carbamazepine was stopped. One year after starting ART, her CD4 count had recovered to 535 cells/μL and she had returned to work.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus. The diagnosis was made in the context of a new-onset seizure in a patient with advanced HIV and immunosuppression (CD4 count 153). Brain CT findings of non-enhancing hypodense white matter lesions were highly suggestive, and the diagnosis was later confirmed by the detection of JC-virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid.

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman who lives in a crowded back room within a remote community. Her family noted she had become increasingly withdrawn and was not leaving the house.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

Her CD4 count upon starting ART was 320 cells/µL. She had completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 months prior.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Abrupt onset of high fever, confusion, and convulsions.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was reported to be well at 8 a.m., but became confused by 10 a.m. and was then drowsy with a high fever and convulsions upon admission to a central hospital at 11 a.m., indicating a very rapid clinical deterioration over just a few hours.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a primary school teacher residing in Malawi. The text notes that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in adults in Africa. There is no mention of specific travel, animal, or other environmental exposures.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, her temperature was 40°C (104°F), pulse was 125 bpm, blood pressure was 125/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was restless and agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10/15. Physical examination revealed a stiff neck, a positive Kernig's sign, photophobia with equal and reactive pupils, and down-going plantar responses. No rash was present. Chest and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. During the physical examination, she suffered a renewed seizure.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 10.5 x10^9/L (neutrophils 8.9 x10^9/L), haemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and normal platelets. A rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum was negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared hazy. CSF analysis showed 35 leukocytes/µL (60% neutrophils), a high protein of 2.6 g/L, and a low glucose of 1.2 mmol/L. The CSF culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were acute bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and cryptococcal meningitis (CCM). Acute bacterial meningitis was deemed most likely due to the hyperacute presentation. TBM was considered less likely due to the patient's recent completion of TB therapy and the rapid onset, while CCM was less likely because her CD4 count was too high and it typically presents more sub-acutely.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: In the emergency department, the patient received ceftriaxone 2g IV for the suspected meningitis, along with 10mg of diazepam IV and 600mg of phenobarbitone IV for seizure control. She completed a 10-day course of IV ceftriaxone. The patient recovered consciousness by day 3, and anticonvulsants were weaned. She developed a minor hearing loss in her right ear but had no other neurological impairment or seizures upon recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was definitively confirmed by a positive CSF culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, altered consciousness, and signs of meningeal irritation (stiff neck, Kernig's sign), combined with classic CSF findings of a neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose. Other causes like tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis were clinically less likely.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old Malawian man with a known history of HIV, who was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis two months prior to presentation. His recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL. His past medical history is significant for treatment for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and a painfully swollen neck.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a six-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, accompanied by a painful neck swelling. Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi and had not left the country. Multi-drug resistance for TB is noted to be uncommon in this region. No other specific occupational or environmental exposures are detailed.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, he was moderately ill, pale, and sweating with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), a pulse of 112 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing man with large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. Over the course of his hospital stay, these glands became more swollen and clearly fluctuant. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 53-year-old Malawian man, who is a non-smoker with an unremarkable past medical history. He was newly diagnosed with HIV infection and found to have advanced immunosuppression, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Productive cough for 3 months with associated night sweats and weight loss.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of productive cough with whitish sputum, night sweats, and unquantified weight loss. Two months prior, he sought care for the same complaints and was treated with presumptive antimalarials and a 5-day course of amoxicillin, with no improvement in his symptoms. He is not on any regular medication.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a subsistence farmer in Malawi. He reports no known tuberculosis (TB) contacts and has no history of working in mines or the construction industry. He is married with five children, who are all well.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 88 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared slightly wasted and mildly anaemic. Examination of the mouth revealed no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma, or oral hairy leukoplakia. His chest was clear to auscultation, and heart sounds were normal without murmurs. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the liver and spleen were not enlarged.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: The HIV test was reactive, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL. Laboratory results showed leukopenia (WBC 3.2 x 10^9/L) and anemia (Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), with normal platelets. Two sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, as were a Malaria RDT and a thick smear for Plasmodium spp. A chest radiograph on admission showed a prominent hilar region bilaterally but was otherwise normal. Induced sputum was also negative for AFB, and sputum PCR was not available.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The most likely diagnosis was smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's HIV-positive status with advanced immunosuppression, chronic constitutional symptoms, and lack of response to antibiotics. Other considerations included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a bacterial chest infection, and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, although the latter was less likely without cutaneous or mucosal lesions. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) was also considered.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole, but his fever persisted. On hospital day 7, he was started on empirical treatment for smear-negative TB with a four-drug regimen (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). After one week of antituberculous therapy, he began to feel better, his fever resolved, and the cough gradually settled. Three weeks into his TB treatment, he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with advanced HIV infection. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, and fever in a severely immunosuppressed individual (CD4 count 54), which is a common presentation for TB in this setting. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's prompt clinical response to empirical antituberculous treatment after failing to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Negative sputum smears and non-specific radiographic findings (hilar prominence) are typical for HIV-associated TB.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: A 4-week history of undulating fever.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient's uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative.

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.\n",

This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient's positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness.

Firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter, are palpable over bony prominences such as the ribs, iliac crest, femoral trochanters, and on the head.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: The diagnosis was considered typical and likely made on clinical grounds in a resource-limited setting. The text suggests potential investigations, including skin snips taken from the vicinity of a nodule to identify microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, and a slit-lamp examination to detect microfilariae in the anterior chamber and cornea. Serological tests for IgG4 responses to O. volvulus antigens (like Ov16) are also mentioned as a diagnostic option. It is not stated that these tests were performed for this patient.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman who lives in a crowded back room within a remote community. Her family noted she had become increasingly withdrawn and was not leaving the house.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 40-year-old Thai woman, a housewife who has lived in Germany for the past 13 years, with an unremarkable past medical history. She presented to an outpatient clinic in Germany.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Severe headache for the past 8 days.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported an 8-day history of severe, gradual-onset headache that did not respond to painkillers. She denied fever, chills, visual problems, limb weakness, or memory problems. Three days earlier, she had presented to a municipal hospital where a CT scan of her brain and a blood count were both normal. Her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared meals while traveling, also developed a severe headache.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Ten days prior to presentation, the patient returned from a 4-week journey to north-east Thailand, where she visited friends and relatives. During her visit, she ate traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. The occurrence of similar symptoms in her brother-in-law after sharing meals suggests a common source outbreak.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a supple neck and a negative Lasègue's sign. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, with no cranial nerve palsies. The remainder of the neurological examination was unremarkable, including higher cortical functions. There was no rash, oral thrush, subcutaneous swellings, lymphadenopathy, or enlargement of the liver and spleen. The cardiopulmonary examination was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (WBC 12.3 x 10⁹/L) with marked peripheral eosinophilia (2.34 x 10⁹/L) and an elevated IgE of 944 U/mL. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 34 cmH2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 1877 leukocytes/µL with 42% eosinophils, elevated protein at 1.59 g/L, and low glucose at 1.85 mmol/L. CSF microscopy, cultures, and antigen tests for bacteria and fungi were negative. After discharge, serology results came back positive, with a Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD antigen of Angiostrongylus cantonensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The presumptive diagnosis was a food-borne parasitic infection causing eosinophilic meningitis, supported by the travel history, dietary exposure, and peripheral eosinophilia. The main differential diagnoses for eosinophilic meningitis considered included fungal infections, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Other parasitic causes such as neurocysticercosis, fascioliasis, and paragonimiasis were ruled out by negative serologies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent repeated lumbar punctures, which relieved her headache. She was prescribed iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia but received no specific antiparasitic treatment. After a one-week hospital stay, she was discharged significantly improved. At a 4-week follow-up, she had fully recovered, and her peripheral eosinophil count had returned to normal.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis due to infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis. This is supported by the clinical presentation of severe headache, the exposure history involving consumption of potential intermediate hosts like snails or frogs in an endemic region, and laboratory findings of marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot test showing specific antibodies against the 31kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: For the past week, the patient has experienced fever, chills, headache, body aches, and severe right hypochondrial pain. He also developed a dry cough in the past few days, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and is exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Sri Lanka and has a 10 to 15-year history of daily consumption of 'toddy', a locally brewed alcohol made from coconut flowers. The text notes that this specific alcoholic drink is locally known to be linked with amoebiasis, possibly through contamination of the clay containers used for collection. The case occurs in an Asian setting where amoebiasis, hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and melioidosis are endemic considerations.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the temperature was 38.3°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally ill, mildly dehydrated, and in pain. There was no jaundice, pallor, or lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed a tender hepatomegaly, with the most prominent tenderness located over the 6th to 9th intercostal spaces in the right mid-axillary line. The spleen was not enlarged. Lung auscultation revealed a few inspiratory crackles over the right lung base. The cardiovascular and nervous systems were clinically normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory investigations revealed a leukocytosis (WBC 14.7 ×10^9/L), elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 48 mg/L), and abnormal liver function tests with a disproportionately elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP 446 U/L) and mildly elevated transaminases (AST 54 U/L, ALT 38 U/L). A chest radiograph showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm and patchy shadows in the right lower zone. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall measuring 7x6 cm in the right liver lobe, along with a small right-sided pleural effusion. Aspiration of the lesion yielded brownish pus.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was between an amoebic and a pyogenic liver abscess. An amoebic liver abscess was considered more likely given the epidemiological setting, the patient's age, lack of comorbidities, and the known association with 'toddy' consumption. Pyogenic abscess, particularly from hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae, was also a consideration due to its prevalence in Southeast Asia. Melioidosis was another differential, as it is endemic in Sri Lanka and can cause organ abscesses, with alcoholism being a risk factor. Infectious hepatitis was deemed less likely due to only slightly elevated transaminases and the absence of jaundice.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Due to its large size, the liver lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance. The patient was treated with metronidazole for ten days. He responded well to this management, making a rapid and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is amoebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This was strongly suggested by the clinical picture of fever and right upper quadrant pain, physical findings of tender hepatomegaly and intercostal tenderness, and imaging showing a large, solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm. The diagnosis was further supported by the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus' (necrotic liver tissue) and the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy, a standard treatment for amoebiasis.\n",

She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness. The patient's positive response to albendazole therapy further supports the diagnosis.\n",

He had previously kept bees and been stung frequently without ill effect, but 9 months prior to admission, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed an asthmatic attack that resolved spontaneously.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, and a feeling of impending death.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported a suspected tick bite on his ankle two days before presenting. Twenty-four hours later, he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He was seen at a clinic where a malaria blood film was negative and was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash and subsequently became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, an expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months, was walking in the countryside two days before his illness began. A more specific exposure was later identified: a visit to a national game park two weeks before his illness, where he suffered numerous painful bites from tsetse flies.\n",

A blood film for malaria parasites, chest radiograph, and stool and urine microscopy were all negative. On day 3, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. A lumbar puncture performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was anaphylactic shock, presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (like acute schistosomiasis), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease, though the absence of eosinophilia was noted. After the clinical picture changed on day 3, with fever, headache, and a new rash, trypanosomiasis was suspected.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated for anaphylactic shock with intramuscular adrenaline, with good effect. He was admitted and received intermittent IM adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistamines for two days. After the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was confirmed on day 3, he was treated with a full course of suramin, totaling 5.75g, starting with a test dose. His urine was monitored weekly during treatment and showed transient protein, casts, and white cells, which resolved after treatment finished.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis, likely caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. Although the initial presentation was an atypical anaphylactic shock, the subsequent development of fever, headache, an erythematous rash, and the recognition of a trypanosomal chancre at the bite site led to the correct diagnosis. The key epidemiological link was the exposure to tsetse fly bites in a game park two weeks prior. The infection was determined to be first-stage as the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",

HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: The HIV test was reactive, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL. Laboratory results showed leukopenia (WBC 3.2 x 10^9/L) and anemia (Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), with normal platelets. Two sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, as were a Malaria RDT and a thick smear for Plasmodium spp. A chest radiograph on admission showed a prominent hilar region bilaterally but was otherwise normal. Induced sputum was also negative for AFB, and sputum PCR was not available.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The most likely diagnosis was smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's HIV-positive status with advanced immunosuppression, chronic constitutional symptoms, and lack of response to antibiotics. Other considerations included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a bacterial chest infection, and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, although the latter was less likely without cutaneous or mucosal lesions. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) was also considered.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole, but his fever persisted. On hospital day 7, he was started on empirical treatment for smear-negative TB with a four-drug regimen (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). After one week of antituberculous therapy, he began to feel better, his fever resolved, and the cough gradually settled. Three weeks into his TB treatment, he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with advanced HIV infection. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, and fever in a severely immunosuppressed individual (CD4 count 54), which is a common presentation for TB in this setting. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's prompt clinical response to empirical antituberculous treatment after failing to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Negative sputum smears and non-specific radiographic findings (hilar prominence) are typical for HIV-associated TB.\n",

Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for genital ulceration were Herpes simplex, syphilis, and chancroid. Herpes ulcers are typically self-limiting over a few days in immunocompetent hosts. Syphilis ulcers are usually painless and single. Chancroid ulcers are often multiple and painful. Because the clinical diagnosis is considered unreliable, syndromic management covering both syphilis and chancroid was recommended.\n",

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10 kg over the past 5 months. At presentation, he was short of breath at rest but able to complete full sentences.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in London and travels extensively for business, with work trips in the past 6 months to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. He lives with his male partner. No other specific exposures were mentioned.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation (sO2) of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of O2.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert but short of breath at rest. Auscultation of the chest was clear. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n",

The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.\n",

She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 72-year-old male farmer from northern Laos. No underlying comorbidities or immunosuppression were reported. Liver function tests and serum glucose remained normal during treatment.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on the left foot and lower leg, with acute swelling and pain for three days.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The condition began ten years prior, following a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week after the bite, a small painless red nodule developed at the site. Over the subsequent years, the lesion slowly enlarged, and further cauliflower-like and plaque-like lesions developed, spreading up to his knee. Three days before admission, his ankle became acutely painful and swollen, prompting him to seek care.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer residing in northern Laos. The initial lesion developed at the site of a leech bite ten years ago, suggesting traumatic inoculation in an agricultural setting. The causative agents for this condition are typically found in plant debris or forest detritus, and male agricultural workers are the most commonly affected demographic.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal, and the patient was afebrile upon admission.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and hot skin. There were multiple cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were described as partly erythematous, partly fungating, and purulent, with a bad odour.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Bacterial culture of pus from the lesions grew Escherichia coli. Direct microscopic investigation of wet film skin scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis, which were made more visible with 10% potassium hydroxide solution. PCR from skin tissue was positive, and sequencing showed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic verrucous skin lesions included fungal infections like sporotrichosis and mycetoma, as well as mycobacterial infections such as cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and Kaposi's Sarcoma were also considered. Non-infectious causes like squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis were possibilities. The acute signs of pain, swelling, and purulence suggested a secondary bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: A secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and treated with local iodine-based antiseptics and initial oral antibiotics (cloxacillin and metronidazole), which were later changed to co-trimoxazole based on culture sensitivities. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days, monthly pulse therapy) along with surgical debridement. Later, oral terbinafine (500-750 mg/d for 9 months) and local terbinafine ointment were added. The lesions healed uneventfully, leaving some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection. This was confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of brownish, round, multiseptate sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies') on direct microscopy of skin scrapings. The causative agent was identified by PCR and sequencing as Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, F. nubica). The clinical presentation of slowly progressive verrucous lesions on a lower limb following minor trauma in a farmer is classic for this disease. The patient also had a secondary bacterial superinfection with E. coli, which was successfully treated.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: A localized, itchy swelling on the left leg that has been slowly developing over three weeks.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: A 26-year-old female presents with a localized swelling on her left leg that developed slowly over the past 3 weeks. The lesion is reported to be itchy but not painful. She has no history of fever or recalled arthropod bites and feels well systemically.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had just returned from a 6-week backpacking trip to Ghana. In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is often caused by the Tumbu fly, which lays eggs on damp laundry or sandy ground. Humans can become hosts by wearing contaminated clothing that has not been hot-ironed or by lying on contaminated ground.\n",
            "**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile at the time of examination. No other vital signs were reported.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: On the left leg, there was a localized swelling approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, covered by a blackish scab. The surrounding skin was slightly hyperaemic. There was no associated lymphadenopathy, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: No laboratory or imaging studies were performed. Diagnosis was made clinically after the scab was removed, revealing a whitish, pulsating matter underneath that was oozing transparent fluid. Under a magnifying glass, this was identified as the pulsating end of a larva, containing respiratory spiracles, which is typical for myiasis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included rickettsial disease and cutaneous anthrax, which were deemed unlikely due to the absence of systemic symptoms. A spider bite was also considered but made less probable by the slow growth over weeks. Localized bacterial infections like furuncles were a possibility given the travel history, but the most likely diagnosis was myiasis (infestation with fly maggots) based on the slow growth, lack of systemic signs, and localized itch.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The lesion was managed by occluding the larva's respiratory spiracles to deprive it of oxygen. The area was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned two days later, at which point the maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with forceps. The remaining lesion appeared clean, and no further treatment was necessary. The condition is noted to be self-limiting as the mature larva eventually leaves the host.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga. The diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical presentation of a slowly growing, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and definitively established by the direct visualization of the pulsating larva with its respiratory spiracles after removal of the scab, followed by its successful extraction. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial infection or spider bite were excluded based on the lesion's slow, non-painful evolution and the absence of systemic symptoms.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.\n",

            "**Vitals**: On examination, the patient's temperature was 36.5°C, blood pressure was 105/90 mmHg, heart rate was 120 bpm, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. His peripheral oxygen saturation was 93% on air. His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 14/15.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was drowsy but rousable with a weak radial pulse but normal heart sounds. Respiratory examination revealed a dull percussion note and reduced breath sounds at both lung bases. The abdomen was mildly distended with shifting dullness and a tender liver edge palpable 3cm below the costal margin. Skin examination was unremarkable.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission showed haemoconcentration (Haematocrit 53.9%), thrombocytopenia (Platelets 58 ×10^9/L), and leukopenia (WCC 2.1 ×10^9/L) with both neutropenia and lymphopenia. C-reactive protein was 20 mg/L, and lactate was elevated at 3.5 mmol/L. Liver function tests were deranged with an ALT of 812 U/L. Ultrasound scans confirmed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, mild hepatomegaly, and a thickened gallbladder wall. A subsequent haematocrit rose to 55.1%. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnosis was dengue infection progressing to severe disease, which was considered typical given the clinical picture and high-endemicity area. Other considerations included rickettsial infections like scrub typhus. Malaria was considered, but the risk was low in urban Vietnam and there was no evidence of haemolysis. Leptospirosis was also a possibility, but less likely without a history of rodent exposure. Melioidosis was also considered in the context of a diabetic patient from Southeast Asia with possible sepsis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was diagnosed with compensated shock and admitted to a high-dependency unit for close observation and supportive care. He was managed with careful fluid resuscitation using Ringer's lactate, starting at 10mL/kg/hr and increasing to 15mL/kg/hr due to persistent tachycardia, oliguria, and a rising haematocrit. The fluid rate was subsequently tapered as his condition improved. Clinical status and haematocrit were monitored frequently. The patient made a complete recovery and was discharged from the hospital 3 days later.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe dengue with compensated shock. This was confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and a positive NS1 ELISA test. The diagnosis is supported by the typical clinical progression from a febrile illness to a critical phase with signs of shock (tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure), laboratory evidence of haemoconcentration and severe thrombocytopenia, and ultrasound findings demonstrating vascular leakage (pleural effusions, ascites).\n",

The full blood count, creatinine, urea, and liver function tests were normal. CRP was slightly elevated at 6.7 mg/dL. His CD4 count was 150/µL, and his HIV viral load was 1,500,000 copies/mL. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral perihilar infiltrates, and a chest CT showed extensive 'ground-glass' infiltrates with no pulmonary emboli. Serum β-D-glucan was >500 pg/mL. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with Grocott staining revealing Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms and a strongly positive PCR for P. jirovecii DNA.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the patient was ART-naïve and HIV-positive with a low CD4 count, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the leading differential. Other possibilities considered included tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis, particularly in light of his extensive travel. Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n",

            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is an immigrant from northern Peru, a tropical region described as highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. He has resided in Chile for the last 9 years. His family history is notable for two close relatives (mother and brother) dying from wasting syndromes of unknown origin. Later investigation revealed his wife had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and was also HTLV-1 positive; one of his two children also had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection but was HTLV-1 negative.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: The patient is cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass, a body weight of 44 kg, and a BMI of 17. Abdominal examination revealed slight pain on palpation. Otherwise, the physical examination was normal, with no fever, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable lymphadenopathy, and no peripheral oedema.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis (WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L), thrombocytosis (platelets 644 x 10^9/L), mild anemia (haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (protein 4.9 g/dL), and an elevated ESR (26 mm/h). An HIV test was negative. Abdominal CT and MRI scans were without pathological findings, and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was macroscopically normal. However, histology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Subsequent Baermann testing of a fresh stool sample demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis, and larvae were also found in respiratory secretions. Serology confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea and wasting in this patient centered on helminth infections. The two main considerations were Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium or Cystoisospora belli were also a possibility, though less likely in an HIV-negative patient. Given the patient's origin from a region highly endemic for S. stercoralis, this was considered the most probable cause.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. Following the diagnosis, he was treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day for 7 days), which was repeated after a 2-week interval. He recovered from his diarrhea and abdominal symptoms within weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, he had gained 13 kg, was free of postprandial cramps for the first time in over 10 years, and parasitological examination was negative. His wife and one child were also found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and were presumably treated.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann technique) and respiratory secretions. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a known risk factor, HTLV-1 co-infection (confirmed by serology), and the patient's geographic origin from an endemic area. The clinical picture of severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, along with the dramatic response to ivermectin, solidified the diagnosis.\n",

Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",

            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had just returned from a 6-week backpacking trip to Ghana. In sub-Saharan Africa, myiasis is often caused by the Tumbu fly, which lays eggs on damp laundry or sandy ground. Humans can become hosts by wearing contaminated clothing that has not been hot-ironed or by lying on contaminated ground.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: No laboratory or imaging studies were performed. Diagnosis was made clinically after the scab was removed, revealing a whitish, pulsating matter underneath that was oozing transparent fluid. Under a magnifying glass, this was identified as the pulsating end of a larva, containing respiratory spiracles, which is typical for myiasis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included rickettsial disease and cutaneous anthrax, which were deemed unlikely due to the absence of systemic symptoms. A spider bite was also considered but made less probable by the slow growth over weeks. Localized bacterial infections like furuncles were a possibility given the travel history, but the most likely diagnosis was myiasis (infestation with fly maggots) based on the slow growth, lack of systemic signs, and localized itch.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The lesion was managed by occluding the larva's respiratory spiracles to deprive it of oxygen. The area was covered with white petroleum jelly and bandaged. The patient returned two days later, at which point the maggot of a Tumbu fly was easily removed with forceps. The remaining lesion appeared clean, and no further treatment was necessary. The condition is noted to be self-limiting as the mature larva eventually leaves the host.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga. The diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical presentation of a slowly growing, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and definitively established by the direct visualization of the pulsating larva with its respiratory spiracles after removal of the scab, followed by its successful extraction. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial infection or spider bite were excluded based on the lesion's slow, non-painful evolution and the absence of systemic symptoms.\n",

In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",

The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n",
            "**Vitals**: None\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi with no history of trauma or past tuberculosis. His HIV status was initially unknown but he was later found to be HIV-positive. He is a non-smoker but drinks about one litre of a locally brewed beer daily. He is married with three children who are all well.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 3-year-old boy from a rural area in Laos who was previously well, developing normally, and up to date with his vaccinations. He had no history of previous ear infections, dental problems, or known trauma.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with fever and poor appetite.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful swelling of the right cheek, accompanied by fever and poor appetite. Three days before presenting to the clinic, his mother observed a purulent discharge from his ear. There was no associated cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from a rural rice-farming family in Laos. This environment likely led to frequent exposure to soil and water in paddy fields, which are known to harbor the causative bacterium, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, in endemic areas.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the child had a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The child appeared unwell. Examination revealed a localized, fluctuant, hot, and tender swelling consistent with a parotid mass, measuring 6 to 8 cm in diameter, below and anterior to the right ear. There was a purulent discharge in the right auditory canal, suspicion of a fistula, and a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and chest examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 ×10⁹/L with 90% neutrophils, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL. Pus cultures from both the right ear and the parotid abscess grew *Burkholderia pseudomallei*. The blood culture was negative. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included acute bacterial suppurative parotitis caused by common pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*. However, given the endemic location in Laos, melioidosis caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* was a strong consideration. Viral causes such as mumps were less likely due to the suppurative nature of the infection and the patient's vaccination status. Other causes like granulomatous parotitis were considered less probable due to the acute and painful presentation.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent incision and drainage of the parotid abscess, with removal of copious pus. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime for 10 days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 16 weeks. The patient had a good clinical response, with no complications, and no underlying predisposing medical conditions were identified.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is localized melioidosis presenting as suppurative parotitis. The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, was definitively identified from cultures of pus from the ear and the parotid abscess. The clinical picture of an acute, febrile, suppurative parotid abscess with facial nerve palsy in a child from an endemic region with environmental exposure is characteristic of this presentation of melioidosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old man from Malawi. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously, affecting the right side of his abdomen, which healed spontaneously and was likely herpes zoster. The patient was subsequently found to be HIV positive.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: A history of right upper abdominal pain and a feeling of faintness, particularly on standing and walking.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until one month prior to admission, when he developed a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he experienced pain in the right upper abdomen, which was more apparent when sleeping on his right side. He recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint, especially upon standing up.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a region where tuberculosis is highly endemic. The history of a skin lesion suggestive of herpes zoster is a strong pointer to underlying HIV infection, which is common in tuberculosis patients in central and southern Africa.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, his pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mm Hg. Following pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immediately.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was thin and slightly breathless in a supine position. His jugular venous pulse appeared elevated. The apex beat was impalpable, and heart sounds were quiet but audible. Auscultation of the chest was normal. Examination revealed an enlarged, tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction, along with mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.8 G/L. A chest radiograph demonstrated an enlarged, globular heart with clear lung fields. An HIV test was positive. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration yielded 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid. An ultrasound of the heart was recommended to confirm pericardial fluid and an electrocardiogram to show low-voltage QRS complexes.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical findings of tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds pointed to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. In Africa, causes include tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, malignancy, and HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the patient's prior herpes zoster suggesting HIV and the high endemicity, the most likely diagnosis was considered to be HIV-associated tuberculosis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration, removing 500 mL of fluid, which resulted in immediate blood pressure improvement. He was started on standard first-line antituberculous therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months) and prednisolone at 60 mg daily, tapered over ten weeks. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment. The patient made a full and uneventful recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was pericardial tamponade secondary to tuberculous pericarditis in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. This was supported by the clinical signs of tamponade, an enlarged globular heart on chest X-ray, the aspiration of 500mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid, and the patient's positive HIV status. The diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause was presumptive but highly likely given the epidemiology in Malawi and the patient's dramatic and full recovery on antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman who lives in a crowded back room within a remote community. Her family noted she had become increasingly withdrawn and was not leaving the house.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Widespread exfoliating rash with signs of sepsis and increasing social withdrawal.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. The rash produced many flakes of skin, and she had fissures over her wrists and knees. Concurrently, she became increasingly withdrawn and socially isolated, with signs of systemic illness including poor responsiveness.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, where scabies is endemic. She lives in a crowded house, and many household members, particularly children, were found to have multiple scabies lesions, some with secondary pyoderma. She was identified as a potential 'core transmitter' of scabies within the household.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash with fissures over her wrists and knees. The rash was most prominent on the limbs, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were noted on her mattress.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification revealed multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. Initial blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, identifying it as community-acquired MRSA. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures taken 48 hours after admission were negative. Other initial labs sent included a full blood count, CRP, and biochemistry, but their results are not detailed.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The provisional diagnosis was crusted scabies, which is well-recognized in this population. The systemic illness was attributed to secondary sepsis, likely from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia inoculated through skin fissures. Gram-negative or polymicrobial sepsis was also considered a possibility in patients with crusted scabies.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial management included oxygen, 1 litre of normal saline, IV ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Her blood pressure improved to 95 mmHg systolic and oxygen saturation to 97% on nasal prongs before evacuation to a regional hospital. There, she was treated for scabies with a five-dose course of ivermectin and topical benzyl benzoate with a keratolytic cream. For the MRSA bacteremia, she received a 2-week course of IV vancomycin. She became afebrile, came off oxygen, and was eating well. Her family members were treated with topical permethrin, and the children also received intramuscular benzathine penicillin. The patient returned to her community after 3 weeks with resolved skin findings.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies (hyperinfestation with Sarcoptes scabiei) complicated by secondary sepsis from community-acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The scabies diagnosis was definitively confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA infection was confirmed by blood culture. The patient's clinical picture of a widespread, exfoliative rash, residence in an endemic community, and signs of severe systemic infection were all consistent with this diagnosis.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness.

The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",

After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

A few days later, a small painless erythematous papule appeared, which later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks, new pustules appeared, the lesion ulcerated and increased in size despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule, he noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. He was seen at a regional hospital and treated empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials but showed no improvement, leading to a referral.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The initial lesion was caused by a scratch from a tree branch while working in the fields. He denied recent contact with animals or travel.\n",

            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a WBC of 4.5 × 10^9/L with a normal differential count and mild anaemia with a haemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL. A chest x-ray and PPD skin test were normal and negative, respectively. Direct microscopy for leishmania parasites and a leishmanin skin test were negative. Mycobacterial cultures were also negative. Definitive diagnosis was established when culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, and mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or M. marinum). Leishmaniasis was considered highly suggestive by the patient's origin and presentation, but the lack of response to a full course of pentavalent antimonials made it unlikely. Sporotrichosis was considered a top diagnosis due to the typical clinical features. Other causes like Nocardiosis and tularaemia were considered unlikely due to geographic rarity.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial empiric treatments with antibiotics, topical traditional medicines, and a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials for suspected leishmaniasis all failed to produce improvement. Following the definitive diagnosis, the patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg/day orally. After 8 months of treatment, the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved, and the patient was considered cured.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. This was confirmed by the positive culture of S. schenckii from both ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration specimens. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic clinical syndrome of a primary ulcer with nodular lymphangitis (sporotrichoid spread) following traumatic inoculation with plant matter in an agricultural worker.

            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. Common bacterial infections, cutaneous anthrax, and tularemia were considered less likely due to the chronic nature, location, and lack of associated symptoms like edema. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was considered the most likely diagnosis due to the frequency of the disease in the valley the patient travelled to and the characteristic presentation of a localized, painless ulcer with raised edges.\n",

Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210.

            "**Patient Information**: A 25-year-old Malawian primary school teacher who is HIV-positive and on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz for 6 months with good adherence. Her CD4 count upon starting ART was 320 cells/µL. She had completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 months prior.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Abrupt onset of high fever, confusion, and convulsions.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was reported to be well at 8 a.m., but became confused by 10 a.m. and was then drowsy with a high fever and convulsions upon admission to a central hospital at 11 a.m., indicating a very rapid clinical deterioration over just a few hours.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a primary school teacher residing in Malawi. The text notes that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in adults in Africa. There is no mention of specific travel, animal, or other environmental exposures.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, her temperature was 40°C (104°F), pulse was 125 bpm, blood pressure was 125/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was restless and agitated with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10/15. Physical examination revealed a stiff neck, a positive Kernig's sign, photophobia with equal and reactive pupils, and down-going plantar responses. No rash was present. Chest and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. During the physical examination, she suffered a renewed seizure.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 10.5 x10^9/L (neutrophils 8.9 x10^9/L), haemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and normal platelets. A rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum was negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared hazy. CSF analysis showed 35 leukocytes/µL (60% neutrophils), a high protein of 2.6 g/L, and a low glucose of 1.2 mmol/L. The CSF culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were acute bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and cryptococcal meningitis (CCM). Acute bacterial meningitis was deemed most likely due to the hyperacute presentation. TBM was considered less likely due to the patient's recent completion of TB therapy and the rapid onset, while CCM was less likely because her CD4 count was too high and it typically presents more sub-acutely.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: In the emergency department, the patient received ceftriaxone 2g IV for the suspected meningitis, along with 10mg of diazepam IV and 600mg of phenobarbitone IV for seizure control. She completed a 10-day course of IV ceftriaxone. The patient recovered consciousness by day 3, and anticonvulsants were weaned. She developed a minor hearing loss in her right ear but had no other neurological impairment or seizures upon recovery.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was definitively confirmed by a positive CSF culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, altered consciousness, and signs of meningeal irritation (stiff neck, Kernig's sign), combined with classic CSF findings of a neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose.

            "**Vitals**: On admission, all vital signs were normal and the patient was afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was markedly increased at 50 cmH2O (normal: 10-18 cmH2O).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: The patient was wasted and slightly anaemic with a normal GCS of 15/15 and no neck stiffness. Visual acuity was normal bilaterally. Examination revealed an abduction deficit of the left eye on left lateral gaze, consistent with an abducens nerve palsy, which she described as 'blurring of vision'. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.7x10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL with a normal MCV (92 fL), and platelets of 91x10⁹/L, indicating leukopenia, normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. A Malaria RDT was negative. HIV serology was positive with a CD4 count of 22/µL. A lumbar puncture revealed clear CSF with an opening pressure of 50 cmH2O. CSF analysis showed 18 leukocytes/µL, elevated protein at 0.8 g/L, and low glucose at 1.97 mmol/L. The India Ink stain was negative, but the CSF culture grew Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing was not available.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was chronic meningitis, with cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculous meningitis being the most important considerations. Partially treated bacterial meningitis was considered less likely due to the gradual onset of symptoms. Malaria was deemed an unlikely diagnosis due to the absence of fever, a negative RDT, prior antimalarial treatment, and the presence of a cranial nerve palsy, which is not typical for malaria.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was started on oral fluconazole 1200 mg for cryptococcal meningitis, as amphotericin B and flucytosine were unavailable. She also received co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and underwent repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures for headache relief. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated 4 weeks into her antifungal treatment. Despite this management, the patient returned to her village and died 6 weeks later of an unknown cause.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans in the setting of advanced, untreated HIV infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive CSF culture for C. neoformans. Clinical evidence included a subacute headache, abducens nerve palsy, and markedly elevated intracranial pressure, all classic features of the disease in a severely immunocompromised individual (CD4 count 22/µL). The negative India Ink stain was noted but is known to have limited sensitivity.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old woman from northern Tanzania. She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n",
            "**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n",

            "**Patient Information**: A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India. He had a history of a dog bite one month prior to symptom onset, for which he received five doses of purified chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).\n",
            "**Chief Complaint**: Admission to hospital for fever and quadriparesis.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient experienced fever for four days, which was followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg. The weakness subsequently progressed to involve all four limbs over the next two days, resulting in a rapidly progressive quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, from southern India (a rabies-endemic country), reported a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb one month before his symptoms began. He received a full course of five anti-rabies vaccine doses but did not receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as part of his post-exposure prophylaxis.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was conscious with normal mental functions (GCS 15/15). The neurological examination revealed a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood investigations, including serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a protein level of 52 mg/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and a pleocytosis of 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes). A saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR, while a CSF sample was negative for the virus.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: A high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies was maintained due to the dog bite history and presentation. Clinical mimics considered included Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and post-vaccination encephalomyelitis. However, features such as fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, and significant CSF pleocytosis helped differentiate this case from GBS.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: After admission, the patient's condition worsened, developing autonomic instability with increased perspiration and variable heart rate and blood pressure. He progressed to dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day of hospitalization. His management was supportive. The patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days after the onset of his symptoms.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is paralytic rabies. This is based on the classic history of a WHO category III dog bite one month prior in a rabies-endemic area, followed by a clinical presentation of fever and rapidly progressive, ascending flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR in a saliva sample. The failure to administer rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) after the severe exposure was a critical lapse in post-exposure prophylaxis, which likely led to the development of the fatal disease despite vaccination.\n",

            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.\n",
            "**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.\n",
            "**Vitals**: On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n",
            "**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.\n",
            "**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.\n",

            "**Chief Complaint**: Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a 3-month period.\n",
            "**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's problems began approximately 3 months earlier with a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed insidiously, and over the following weeks, her left arm also became affected. She is noted to be a poor historian. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment, or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable.\n",

Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.\n",
            "**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for focal brain lesions in this HIV-positive patient included cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CNS tuberculosis. The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.\n",
            "**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's existing antiretroviral, antituberculous, and co-trimoxazole therapies were continued. She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.\n",
            "**Final Diagnosis**: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.\n",
