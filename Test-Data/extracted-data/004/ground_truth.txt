The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan Giardia intestinalis. The patient's history of backpacking in India, followed by the development of chronic diarrhea with bloating, flatulence, weight loss, and foul-smelling, fatty stools (steatorrhea) is classic for this infection. Although he had an initial Campylobacter infection, the persistence and evolution of his symptoms prompted further testing. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying Giardia cysts in a stool specimen on microscopy.
