A 24-year-old man presents after a 3-month backpacking trip to India. He initially developed watery, non-bloody diarrhea which resolved, and a stool culture at that time grew Campylobacter. Two weeks after returning home, he developed recurrent diarrhea, loss of appetite, bloating, and significant flatulence. He notes that his stools are particularly foul-smelling and difficult to flush. The patient has also started to lose weight. His doctor ordered stool microscopy to investigate for ova, cysts, and parasites.
