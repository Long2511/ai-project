The diagnosis is malaria, caused by a Plasmodium species. This is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to The Gambia, a malaria-endemic region. Her clinical presentation is classic for malaria, featuring paroxysms of high fever (39.5°C), chills, rigors, and sweats. Although she took prophylaxis, its failure is not uncommon. The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying Plasmodium parasites on a peripheral blood smear or through a rapid diagnostic antigen test.
