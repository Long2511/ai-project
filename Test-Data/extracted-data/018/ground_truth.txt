The final diagnosis is chronic paracoccidioidomycosis. This is supported by the patient's epidemiology (male agricultural worker from an endemic area in Brazil), the chronicity of the illness, and the classic clinical presentation involving both the lungs and the oral mucosa (mulberry-like stomatitis). The diagnosis is confirmed by direct microscopic examination of a biopsy from an oral lesion or a sputum sample, which reveals the characteristic large, multiple-budding yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, often described as a "mariner's wheel."
