A 52-year-old male farmer from rural Brazil presents with a six-month history of progressive weight loss, productive cough, and painful sores in his mouth. He has difficulty eating due to the oral lesions. On physical examination, he appears cachectic. The oropharynx reveals multiple ulcerative and granulomatous lesions on the gums and palate, described as having a mulberry-like appearance. Lung examination is notable for bilateral crackles. A chest radiograph shows bilateral, mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the middle and lower lung zones.
