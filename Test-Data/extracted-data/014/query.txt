A 37-year-old woman from Southern Mexico presented with a persistent body rash. Her symptoms began five years prior with spasms and needle-like pain in her arms, accompanied by fatigue. She was initially treated for depression and atopic dermatitis. Physical examination revealed numerous hypopigmented skin lesions on her arms, face, abdomen, back, and legs. She also had thinning eyebrows and numbness in her forearm. A skin biopsy was taken from an abdominal lesion for analysis.
