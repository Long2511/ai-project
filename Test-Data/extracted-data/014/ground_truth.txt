The diagnosis is lepromatous leprosy (LL), a form of Hansen's disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This is supported by the patient's origin from an endemic region (Mexico) and the chronic clinical presentation of numerous hypopigmented skin lesions, thinning eyebrows (madarosis), and peripheral neuropathy (numbness). The diagnosis was confirmed by a skin biopsy from an abdominal lesion, which revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli.
