The diagnosis is hydatid disease, or cystic echinococcosis, caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The clinical suspicion is raised by the patient's origin from an endemic region and the presence of slowly growing cysts in the liver and lungs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the histopathological identification of a hydatid cyst from the excised lung lesion, which is the pathognomonic finding. Positive serology for Echinococcus provided further supportive evidence.
