A 28-year-old Kurdish refugee presented with a four-month history of upper abdominal pain and recent right-sided chest pain. He was afebrile and his weight was stable. An initial chest X-ray showed a mass in the right lung. A subsequent CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated a cystic structure in his liver, with additional cysts in his chest. The right lung lesion was surgically excised for diagnosis. Histopathology of the excised tissue confirmed a parasitic etiology, and serologic tests were also positive.
