A 36-year-old female nurse in Nigeria presented with a three-day history of high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, and vomiting. She had not improved after treatment with antimalarials and ciprofloxacin. On admission, she was febrile, toxic-appearing, dehydrated, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Her condition worsened over the next day with a fever spike to 40.0°C, restlessness, facial puffiness, and respiratory distress with basal lung crepitations. A bedside whole blood clotting time was markedly prolonged at over 20 minutes, although no overt bleeding was observed. Initial laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count and negative blood and urine cultures.
