  "query_for_retriever": "A 36-year-old female nurse in Nigeria presented with a three-day history of high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, and vomiting. She had not improved after treatment with antimalarials and ciprofloxacin. On admission, she was febrile, toxic-appearing, dehydrated, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Her condition worsened over the next day with a fever spike to 40.0°C, restlessness, facial puffiness, and respiratory distress with basal lung crepitations. A bedside whole blood clotting time was markedly prolonged at over 20 minutes, although no overt bleeding was observed. Initial laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count and negative blood and urine cultures.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. This is supported by the patient's presentation as a healthcare worker in an endemic area (Nigeria) with a severe febrile illness unresponsive to antimalarials and antibiotics. The clinical picture progressed to include facial edema, respiratory distress, and a significant coagulopathy (prolonged clotting time), which are features of severe Lassa fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by a viral study, and the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement after the initiation of ribavirin therapy.",
