The diagnosis is Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. This is supported by the patient's presentation as a healthcare worker in an endemic area (Nigeria) with a severe febrile illness unresponsive to antimalarials and antibiotics. The clinical picture progressed to include facial edema, respiratory distress, and a significant coagulopathy (prolonged clotting time), which are features of severe Lassa fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by a viral study, and the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement after the initiation of ribavirin therapy.
