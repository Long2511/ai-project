The diagnosis is chronic schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This is supported by the patient's history of childhood freshwater exposure in Kenya, which led to the development of portal hypertension with hepatosplenomegaly and bleeding esophageal varices. The marked eosinophilia and granulomatous fibrosis on liver biopsy are also classic findings. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying S. mansoni eggs in the stool and on rectal biopsy, with positive serology providing further evidence.
