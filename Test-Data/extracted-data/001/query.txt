A 53-year-old woman presented with fever, cough, and malaise after returning from a visit to Lahore. On examination, her temperature was 38°C and she had a rash on her upper chest. A chest X-ray showed patchy basal consolidation and a full blood count revealed a relative lymphocytosis. Malaria films were negative. Blood cultures were drawn and later grew gram-negative bacilli.
