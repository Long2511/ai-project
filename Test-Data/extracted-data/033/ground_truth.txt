The diagnosis is Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a severe manifestation of infection with the Dengue virus. The clinical picture of a prolonged febrile illness with headache, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia is classic for dengue. The progression to hemorrhagic signs, including gum bleeding, hematuria, purpura, and ecchymoses, combined with severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, meets the criteria for DHF. The diagnosis was confirmed by serologic evidence of dengue virus infection.
