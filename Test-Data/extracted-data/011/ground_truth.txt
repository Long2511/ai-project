The final diagnosis is chronic Chagas disease with associated cardiomyopathy and a resulting embolic stroke. This is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's origin from Brazil, an endemic country, and her clinical presentation with heart failure and a stroke. The characteristic cardiac findings of a dilated left ventricle with an apical aneurysm and intracardiac thrombus are classic for Chagas cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive ELISA test for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies.
