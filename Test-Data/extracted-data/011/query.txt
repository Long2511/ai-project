A 32-year-old woman originally from Brazil presented with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness affecting her face, arm, and leg. She also reported recent shortness of breath on exertion. A CT scan of her brain confirmed an acute stroke. Her ECG was abnormal, showing broadened QRS complexes, and a chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with a characteristic apical aneurysm. A small thrombus was noted within the aneurysm, consistent with a cardioembolic source for her stroke.
