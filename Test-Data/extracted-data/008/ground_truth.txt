The diagnosis is lymphatic filariasis, caused by the nematode Wuchereria bancrofti. This is strongly suggested by the patient's presentation of unilateral limb swelling (lymphedema) and recurrent adenolymphangitis, combined with his origin from an endemic area in Southern India. The diagnosis is supported by key laboratory findings of marked peripheral eosinophilia and a positive filarial serology test. Confirmation can also be achieved by detecting microfilariae on a blood film or through filarial antigen testing.
