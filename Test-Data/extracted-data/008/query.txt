A 24-year-old man from Southern India presented with swelling of his left foot that diminishes overnight. He is afebrile and systemically well but reports a history of recurrent episodes of painful, swollen lymph nodes in his groin. On examination, he has enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was significant for a marked eosinophilia of 1.4×10^9 L–1, while D-dimers were normal. Filarial serology was positive. The patient noted that in his hometown, he had seen individuals with grossly swollen legs.
