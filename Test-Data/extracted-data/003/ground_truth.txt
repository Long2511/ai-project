The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis, likely caused by Leishmania infantum. This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of prolonged fever, massive hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia in a patient with relevant epidemiologic exposure. The patient had recently been camping in southern Spain, a known endemic area, and was exposed to dogs, which are a primary reservoir. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Leishmania on a bone marrow sample.
