A 72-year-old man who lives in the south of Spain presented in the UK with a progressive illness characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and loss of appetite. On examination, he had temperatures up to 39°C and progressive, marked hepatosplenomegaly. Blood tests revealed pancytopenia, and he did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. A bone marrow examination was negative for malignancy and initial stains for organisms were unrevealing. Four months prior to his illness, he had been on a camping trip in a coastal area of Spain, where he recalls seeing many thin dogs.
