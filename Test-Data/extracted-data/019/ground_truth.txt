The diagnosis is uncomplicated malaria, caused by Plasmodium vivax. The key evidence includes the classic clinical syndrome of abrupt fever, chills, malaise, and headache. This occurred within a typical incubation period (8 days) after travel to a highly malaria-endemic area (Iquitos, Peru) with significant mosquito exposure. The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying Plasmodium parasites on a thick and thin peripheral blood smear or by a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
