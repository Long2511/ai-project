An 18-year-old female presents with a five-day history of abrupt onset fever, shaking chills, generalized malaise, headache, and myalgias. She also reports nausea, vomiting, and dark urine that began two days prior to admission. Her symptoms began eight days after she returned from an 8-day trip to a jungle region in Iquitos, Peru. During her trip, she slept in tents, swam in a river, and had inconsistent use of mosquito repellents and nets. On examination, she is febrile to 38°C and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm. The exam is notable for tenderness to palpation in both abdominal flanks, but no jaundice, rash, or signs of bleeding are present.
