The diagnosis is Weil's disease, a severe form of leptospirosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of potential exposure during a military exercise in an endemic area (Belize). The clinical presentation of a biphasic illness progressing to jaundice, renal failure (oliguria, uremia), pneumonia, and conjunctival inflammation is classic for this condition. Key laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin, and uremia.
