A staff sergeant was hospitalized after returning from a military exercise in Belize. He initially presented with fever, headache, and myalgia, but after a brief improvement, his condition deteriorated. He developed jaundice, signs of pneumonia, conjunctival inflammation, and hepatosplenomegaly. A chest X-ray showed bi-basal opacities. Laboratory results revealed neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, elevated conjugated bilirubin, and mild elevation of transaminases. His condition progressed to oliguria and uremia, requiring renal support.
