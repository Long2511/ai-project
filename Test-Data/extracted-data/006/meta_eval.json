  "query_for_retriever": "A staff sergeant was hospitalized after returning from a military exercise in Belize. He initially presented with fever, headache, and myalgia, but after a brief improvement, his condition deteriorated. He developed jaundice, signs of pneumonia, conjunctival inflammation, and hepatosplenomegaly. A chest X-ray showed bi-basal opacities. Laboratory results revealed neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, elevated conjugated bilirubin, and mild elevation of transaminases. His condition progressed to oliguria and uremia, requiring renal support.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is Weil's disease, a severe form of leptospirosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of potential exposure during a military exercise in an endemic area (Belize). The clinical presentation of a biphasic illness progressing to jaundice, renal failure (oliguria, uremia), pneumonia, and conjunctival inflammation is classic for this condition. Key laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin, and uremia.",
