The final diagnosis is Monkeypox (Mpox). This is supported by the patient's presentation with a characteristic diffuse skin rash (pustules, papules, vesicles) in the context of being immunocompromised and having a recent travel history. Although she presented with atypical symptoms like abdominal pain and had pulmonary nodules on CT, the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting viral DNA via a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
