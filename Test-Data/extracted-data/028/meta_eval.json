  "query_for_retriever": "A 57-year-old immunocompromised female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate presented with a 24-hour history of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. She also reported a cough and headache. On examination, she was found to have multiple skin lesions in various stages of evolution, including pustules, papules, and vesicles, distributed across her body. The patient had a history of travel to a coastal area one month prior. Laboratory tests showed an elevated C-reactive protein, and a chest CT scan revealed multiple diffuse solid nodules in both lungs with ground-glass opacities.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The final diagnosis is Monkeypox (Mpox). This is supported by the patient's presentation with a characteristic diffuse skin rash (pustules, papules, vesicles) in the context of being immunocompromised and having a recent travel history. Although she presented with atypical symptoms like abdominal pain and had pulmonary nodules on CT, the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting viral DNA via a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.",
