The diagnosis is Yellow Fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the yellow fever virus. This is strongly supported by the patient's travel to an endemic area (The Gambia) without prior vaccination. Her clinical course was classic, featuring an acute febrile phase followed by a toxic phase with jaundice, renal failure, extremely high liver enzymes, and a severe coagulopathy leading to fatal hemorrhage. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for yellow fever virus on a plasma sample.
