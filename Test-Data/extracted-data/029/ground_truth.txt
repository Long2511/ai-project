The diagnosis is Pott disease, or spinal tuberculosis. This is supported by the patient's risk factors (HIV infection, living in an endemic area) and the clinical findings of a spinal deformity (gibbus) and a large abscess. The CT scan findings of lytic vertebral destruction and a paravertebral cold abscess are classic for this condition. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying acid-fast bacilli on a Ziehl-Neelsen stain and detecting rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis via GeneXpert on a sample from the drained abscess.
