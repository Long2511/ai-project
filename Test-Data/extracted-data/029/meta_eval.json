  "query_for_retriever": "A 27-year-old Ugandan woman with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV presented with a two-month history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. She had a remote history of lower back pain treated as lumbago two years prior, but denied recent constitutional symptoms like cough or weight loss. Examination revealed a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine. An initial ultrasound suggested a psoas abscess. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is Pott disease, or spinal tuberculosis. This is supported by the patient's risk factors (HIV infection, living in an endemic area) and the clinical findings of a spinal deformity (gibbus) and a large abscess. The CT scan findings of lytic vertebral destruction and a paravertebral cold abscess are classic for this condition. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying acid-fast bacilli on a Ziehl-Neelsen stain and detecting rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis via GeneXpert on a sample from the drained abscess.",
