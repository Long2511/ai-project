A 27-year-old Ugandan woman with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV presented with a two-month history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. She had a remote history of lower back pain treated as lumbago two years prior, but denied recent constitutional symptoms like cough or weight loss. Examination revealed a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine. An initial ultrasound suggested a psoas abscess. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh.
