A 10-year-old Tibetan girl presented with a two-month history of moderate to severe headache and nonprojectile vomiting. She had no fever or initial seizures. An important epidemiological clue was that six of her schoolmates presented with similar symptoms and were suspected of having cysticercosis. Laboratory tests showed a mild peripheral eosinophilia and slightly elevated protein and white blood cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. A brain MRI was performed and showed numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum. Some of these lesions had a characteristic "hole-with-dot" appearance, and serum ELISA was positive for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.
