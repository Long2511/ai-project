  "query_for_retriever": "A 10-year-old Tibetan girl presented with a two-month history of moderate to severe headache and nonprojectile vomiting. She had no fever or initial seizures. An important epidemiological clue was that six of her schoolmates presented with similar symptoms and were suspected of having cysticercosis. Laboratory tests showed a mild peripheral eosinophilia and slightly elevated protein and white blood cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. A brain MRI was performed and showed numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum. Some of these lesions had a characteristic \"hole-with-dot\" appearance, and serum ELISA was positive for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is massive neurocysticercosis, caused by infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This is supported by the chronic headache in a child from an endemic region with a cluster of similar cases among her schoolmates. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuroimaging and serology. The brain MRI showed numerous cystic lesions with the pathognomonic \"hole-with-dot\" sign (representing the scolex within the cyst), and serum ELISA for anticysticercal IgG antibodies was positive. The patient's good response to antiparasitic treatment with albendazole and praziquantel further supported the diagnosis.",
