The diagnosis is massive neurocysticercosis, caused by infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This is supported by the chronic headache in a child from an endemic region with a cluster of similar cases among her schoolmates. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuroimaging and serology. The brain MRI showed numerous cystic lesions with the pathognomonic "hole-with-dot" sign (representing the scolex within the cyst), and serum ELISA for anticysticercal IgG antibodies was positive. The patient's good response to antiparasitic treatment with albendazole and praziquantel further supported the diagnosis.
