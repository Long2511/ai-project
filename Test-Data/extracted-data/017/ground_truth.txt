The diagnosis is Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. This is supported by the extremely chronic (six-year) history of a slowly progressive, painless, ulcerative skin lesion in a patient from Peru, an endemic area for the disease. The evolution from a papule to a non-healing ulcer is a classic presentation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by identifying Leishmania amastigotes in a skin biopsy or smear, or by PCR.
