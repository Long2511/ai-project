  "query_for_retriever": "A 49-year-old man was hospitalized for fever, rigors, and diarrhea. His medical history is significant for a trip to Peru eight weeks prior. Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210. Liver function tests were also abnormal, and a blood culture was positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Tests for malaria, dengue, and other common travel-related infections were negative.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is the chronic phase of Oroya fever, known as verruga peruana, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis. This is supported by the patient's travel history to Peru, an endemic region, and the classic biphasic presentation. He initially had an acute febrile illness with anemia (acute Oroya fever), followed by the development of characteristic red vascular skin nodules (verruga peruana). The concurrent Salmonella enteritidis bacteremia is a well-known complication of the immunosuppression associated with acute Oroya fever. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Bartonella bacilliformis.",
