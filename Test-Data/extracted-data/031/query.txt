A 49-year-old man was hospitalized for fever, rigors, and diarrhea. His medical history is significant for a trip to Peru eight weeks prior. Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210. Liver function tests were also abnormal, and a blood culture was positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Tests for malaria, dengue, and other common travel-related infections were negative.
