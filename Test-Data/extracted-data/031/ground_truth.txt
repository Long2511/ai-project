The diagnosis is the chronic phase of Oroya fever, known as verruga peruana, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis. This is supported by the patient's travel history to Peru, an endemic region, and the classic biphasic presentation. He initially had an acute febrile illness with anemia (acute Oroya fever), followed by the development of characteristic red vascular skin nodules (verruga peruana). The concurrent Salmonella enteritidis bacteremia is a well-known complication of the immunosuppression associated with acute Oroya fever. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Bartonella bacilliformis.
