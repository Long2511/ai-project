The diagnosis is chlamydial cervicitis, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation as a sexually active young woman with mid-cycle bleeding, and the characteristic physical exam findings of a mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical friability. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive laboratory test for Chlamydia from an endocervical swab specimen.
