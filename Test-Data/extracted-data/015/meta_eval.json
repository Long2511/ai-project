  "query_for_retriever": "A 40-year-old male from Nepal presented with a four-day history of severe pain, swelling, and discoloration of his left hand. He reported being bitten by a snake on his left little finger four days prior and had not sought any medical care. On examination, he was febrile and tachycardic. There was a large, tense, fluctuant swelling on the dorsum of his left hand with overlying bluish skin discoloration, and the entire left little finger was black. Laboratory studies showed a high white blood cell count with a neutrophilic predominance. An ultrasound of the hand revealed a significant fluid collection consistent with an abscess.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is severe local complications from a snake bite, specifically a hand abscess and digital gangrene. This is supported by the patient's history of a snake bite four days prior with a delayed presentation and no antivenom administration. Clinical evidence included fever, a large fluctuant swelling on the hand, and black discoloration of the finger, indicative of tissue necrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound showing an abscess, which required surgical incision and drainage, debridement, and ultimately, amputation of the gangrenous digit.",
