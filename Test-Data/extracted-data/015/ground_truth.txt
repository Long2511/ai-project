The diagnosis is severe local complications from a snake bite, specifically a hand abscess and digital gangrene. This is supported by the patient's history of a snake bite four days prior with a delayed presentation and no antivenom administration. Clinical evidence included fever, a large fluctuant swelling on the hand, and black discoloration of the finger, indicative of tissue necrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound showing an abscess, which required surgical incision and drainage, debridement, and ultimately, amputation of the gangrenous digit.
