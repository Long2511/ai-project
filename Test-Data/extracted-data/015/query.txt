A 40-year-old male from Nepal presented with a four-day history of severe pain, swelling, and discoloration of his left hand. He reported being bitten by a snake on his left little finger four days prior and had not sought any medical care. On examination, he was febrile and tachycardic. There was a large, tense, fluctuant swelling on the dorsum of his left hand with overlying bluish skin discoloration, and the entire left little finger was black. Laboratory studies showed a high white blood cell count with a neutrophilic predominance. An ultrasound of the hand revealed a significant fluid collection consistent with an abscess.
