A 34-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with a two-week illness. His symptoms began with epigastric pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and fevers up to 39°C. One week into the illness, he developed right-sided pleuritic chest pain. On the day of admission, his symptoms persisted, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The imaging revealed hepatomegaly and a large, heterogeneous liver lesion measuring 13.4 x 3.6 cm.
