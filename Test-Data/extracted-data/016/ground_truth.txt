The diagnosis is an amebic liver abscess, caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The clinical presentation of a subacute febrile illness with right upper quadrant pain is classic. The ultrasound finding of a large, solitary liver lesion in this clinical context is highly suggestive. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by positive serology for E. histolytica antibodies, which are highly sensitive for extraintestinal disease.
