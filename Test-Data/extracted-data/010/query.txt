A 63-year-old man living in a hostel for the homeless presents with a one-month history of weakness, weight loss, night fevers, and breathlessness. He recently began coughing up blood, which prompted him to seek care at a walk-in clinic. On examination, he had a low-grade fever and bronchial breathing was noted on chest auscultation. A chest X-ray was performed, which demonstrated apical shadowing and a large cavitation. A sputum sample was collected for analysis.
