  "query_for_retriever": "An 18-year-old boy from a dengue-endemic area in Sri Lanka presented with a one-day history of high fever, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and subsequent left-sided hemiparesis. On examination, he was drowsy with a GCS of 10, and had a left upper motor neuron facial palsy with flaccid paralysis of his left arm and leg. Initial brain CT was normal, but an MRI showed changes suggestive of right-sided meningoencephalitis. Over the next few days, he developed leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia (23,000 cells/μl), and markedly elevated liver transaminases (AST >4900 U/L). He also showed signs of plasma leakage, including a rising hematocrit and free fluid on ultrasound.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The final diagnosis is dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated by parainfectious dengue encephalitis. This is supported by the patient's presentation with an acute febrile illness and neurological signs in a dengue-endemic region. The development of severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, markedly elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of plasma leakage (rising hematocrit, free fluid on ultrasound) confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis of dengue encephalitis was established by a positive serum dengue NS1 antigen test and positive serum dengue IgM, combined with MRI findings of encephalitis and the later detection of dengue IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid, after excluding other common causes of viral encephalitis.",
