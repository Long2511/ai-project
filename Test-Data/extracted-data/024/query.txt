An 18-year-old boy from a dengue-endemic area in Sri Lanka presented with a one-day history of high fever, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and subsequent left-sided hemiparesis. On examination, he was drowsy with a GCS of 10, and had a left upper motor neuron facial palsy with flaccid paralysis of his left arm and leg. Initial brain CT was normal, but an MRI showed changes suggestive of right-sided meningoencephalitis. Over the next few days, he developed leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia (23,000 cells/μl), and markedly elevated liver transaminases (AST >4900 U/L). He also showed signs of plasma leakage, including a rising hematocrit and free fluid on ultrasound.
