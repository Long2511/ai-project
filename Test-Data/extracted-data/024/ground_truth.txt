The final diagnosis is dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated by parainfectious dengue encephalitis. This is supported by the patient's presentation with an acute febrile illness and neurological signs in a dengue-endemic region. The development of severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, markedly elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of plasma leakage (rising hematocrit, free fluid on ultrasound) confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis of dengue encephalitis was established by a positive serum dengue NS1 antigen test and positive serum dengue IgM, combined with MRI findings of encephalitis and the later detection of dengue IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid, after excluding other common causes of viral encephalitis.
