A 79-year-old male farmer from China presented with high-grade fever, progressive dyspnea, and cough three days after a known tick bite. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed profound thrombocytopenia (25×10^9/L) and leukopenia (1.24×10^9/L). His condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to progressive multiorgan failure with severe metabolic acidosis, acute liver and kidney injury, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Neurological involvement was prominent, with altered mental status, nuchal rigidity, and a declining Glasgow Coma Scale score. Despite aggressive critical care, the patient's condition progressed to refractory viral sepsis and he ultimately died.
