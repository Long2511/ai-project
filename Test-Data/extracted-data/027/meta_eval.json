  "query_for_retriever": "A 79-year-old male farmer from China presented with high-grade fever, progressive dyspnea, and cough three days after a known tick bite. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed profound thrombocytopenia (25×10^9/L) and leukopenia (1.24×10^9/L). His condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to progressive multiorgan failure with severe metabolic acidosis, acute liver and kidney injury, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Neurological involvement was prominent, with altered mental status, nuchal rigidity, and a declining Glasgow Coma Scale score. Despite aggressive critical care, the patient's condition progressed to refractory viral sepsis and he ultimately died.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne phlebovirus. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's history of a tick bite in an endemic region (China) followed by the classic triad of high fever, severe thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The clinical course was marked by rapid progression to multiorgan failure, encephalopathy, and death. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the detection of SFTSV-RNA via multiplex PCR analysis performed by the local disease control center.",
