The diagnosis is Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne phlebovirus. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's history of a tick bite in an endemic region (China) followed by the classic triad of high fever, severe thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The clinical course was marked by rapid progression to multiorgan failure, encephalopathy, and death. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the detection of SFTSV-RNA via multiplex PCR analysis performed by the local disease control center.
