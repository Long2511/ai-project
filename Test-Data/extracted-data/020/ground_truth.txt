The diagnosis is crusted scabies, a severe hyperinfestation with the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis*. The long duration of symptoms (7 months), widespread scaly lesions, and severe pruritus in an elderly patient are highly suggestive of this condition. Unlike classic scabies, crusted scabies is characterized by thick crusts and an extremely high mite burden. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings to identify numerous mites, eggs, or scybala.
