A university professor presents with malaise and headache after returning from a botanical expedition in Kenya. He developed a large, swollen, and painful black lesion on his thigh. An initial course of antibiotics for a suspected skin infection was ineffective, and his headache and myalgia persisted. Upon evaluation at a travel clinic, the lesion was identified as a tick bite. Physical examination also revealed regional lymphadenopathy. Blood was drawn for serology to confirm a suspected tick-borne illness before appropriate antibiotic therapy was started.
