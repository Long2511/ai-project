The diagnosis is African Tick Bite Fever, a form of rickettsiosis. This is strongly suggested by the patient's travel history to Kenya and the clinical presentation of a painful black eschar (tache noire) at the site of a tick bite. The associated symptoms of headache, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy are also characteristic of this infection, which is caused by the bacterium *Rickettsia africae*. The diagnosis is provisionally made based on clinical and epidemiological findings and can be confirmed by serology.
