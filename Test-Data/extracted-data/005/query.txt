A 60-year-old man from Ohio with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presents with severe dyspnea and cough. His medical history is significant for treatment with methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and infliximab, which was started ten weeks prior to presentation. His symptoms rapidly progressed to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral nodular infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained yeast forms, and a urine antigen test was markedly positive. The patient has normal blood cell counts.
