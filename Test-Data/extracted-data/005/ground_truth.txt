The diagnosis is histoplasmosis, caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This is supported by the patient's severe respiratory failure, bilateral nodular infiltrates on chest imaging, and residence in an endemic area (Ohio). His immunosuppressive therapy, particularly the TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab, is a major risk factor for severe disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying yeast forms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a positive Histoplasma urine antigen test, and subsequent confirmation by culture and high complement fixation titers.
