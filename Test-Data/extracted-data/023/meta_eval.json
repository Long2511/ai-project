  "query_for_retriever": "An 18-year-old, previously healthy, unvaccinated postpartum woman presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe dyspnea, chest pain, and respiratory distress. Her symptoms developed approximately six weeks after recovering from an acute viral illness. On arrival, she was tachycardic to 170 beats per minute, tachypneic, and severely hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on high-flow oxygen. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally. An initial chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan confirmed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, a minimal left-sided pneumothorax, and diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation. She later developed a contralateral tension pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The final diagnosis is a severe pulmonary complication of measles. This is supported by the patient's history of a recent measles infection, her unvaccinated status, and the development of acute respiratory failure approximately six weeks later during the convalescent phase. The specific life-threatening complications were bilateral, sequential tension pneumothorax and diffuse lung injury. The diagnosis of the pneumothoraces and parenchymal lung disease was confirmed by chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans.",
