The final diagnosis is a severe pulmonary complication of measles. This is supported by the patient's history of a recent measles infection, her unvaccinated status, and the development of acute respiratory failure approximately six weeks later during the convalescent phase. The specific life-threatening complications were bilateral, sequential tension pneumothorax and diffuse lung injury. The diagnosis of the pneumothoraces and parenchymal lung disease was confirmed by chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans.
