An 18-year-old, previously healthy, unvaccinated postpartum woman presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe dyspnea, chest pain, and respiratory distress. Her symptoms developed approximately six weeks after recovering from an acute viral illness. On arrival, she was tachycardic to 170 beats per minute, tachypneic, and severely hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on high-flow oxygen. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally. An initial chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan confirmed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, a minimal left-sided pneumothorax, and diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation. She later developed a contralateral tension pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube.
