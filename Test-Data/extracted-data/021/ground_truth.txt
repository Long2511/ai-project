This case describes a neonate born free of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to a mother who had a confirmed infection during her third trimester. The mother's infection with Ebola virus was confirmed by PCR at 34 weeks gestation. The diagnosis of an uninfected infant was established by negative PCR tests for Ebola virus on the neonate's umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, and saliva at birth. This represents a rare, favorable outcome, as maternal EVD during pregnancy is associated with extremely high rates of fetal and neonatal mortality.
