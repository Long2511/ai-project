A female neonate was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a 22-year-old mother who was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease via PCR at 34 weeks of gestation. The mother recovered after one week of supportive care. The infant was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks gestation with excellent Apgar scores and a normal physical examination. Multiple diagnostic tests were performed on the newborn at birth. Umbilical cord blood PCR, peripheral blood swabs, and salivary swabs were all negative for Ebola virus. The infant was discharged home and was growing normally at a one-month follow-up appointment.
