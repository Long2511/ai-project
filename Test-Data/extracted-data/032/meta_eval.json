  "query_for_retriever": "A 30-year-old male presented with fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain after returning from Cyprus. He was referred to a hospital for investigation of a pyrexia of unknown origin. On examination, hepato-splenomegaly was noted. A temperature chart recorded by the patient showed an undulant pattern over several weeks. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, with slightly elevated transaminases. A chest X-ray was normal and a T-spot test for tuberculosis was negative.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The diagnosis is brucellosis, caused by a bacterium of the genus *Brucella*. The clinical picture of a pyrexia of unknown origin with night sweats, arthralgia, and hepato-splenomegaly in a traveler returning from an endemic region is highly suggestive. The characteristic undulant fever pattern and laboratory findings of pancytopenia further support the diagnosis. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the isolation of *Brucella* from a blood culture.",
