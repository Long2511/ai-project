A 30-year-old male presented with fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain after returning from Cyprus. He was referred to a hospital for investigation of a pyrexia of unknown origin. On examination, hepato-splenomegaly was noted. A temperature chart recorded by the patient showed an undulant pattern over several weeks. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, with slightly elevated transaminases. A chest X-ray was normal and a T-spot test for tuberculosis was negative.
