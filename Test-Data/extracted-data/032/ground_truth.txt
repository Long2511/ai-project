The diagnosis is brucellosis, caused by a bacterium of the genus *Brucella*. The clinical picture of a pyrexia of unknown origin with night sweats, arthralgia, and hepato-splenomegaly in a traveler returning from an endemic region is highly suggestive. The characteristic undulant fever pattern and laboratory findings of pancytopenia further support the diagnosis. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the isolation of *Brucella* from a blood culture.
