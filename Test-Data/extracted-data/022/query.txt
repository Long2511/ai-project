A 7-year-old boy in Texas presented with a two-day history of right-hand pruritus and arm pain. Over the next few days, his condition worsened to include a rash, delusions, spasms, high fever, hypersalivation, and altered mental status, requiring intubation for airway protection. An extensive initial workup for common central nervous system infections, including various viruses and bacteria, was negative. A detailed history subsequently revealed that the child had been bitten by a bat approximately two months before symptom onset. No post-exposure prophylaxis was administered at the time of the bite because there were no visible marks.
