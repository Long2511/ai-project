The diagnosis is human rabies. This is supported by the clinical presentation of acute progressive neuroencephalitis (altered mental status, seizures, hypersalivation) in a patient with a history of a bat bite two months prior, for which no post-exposure prophylaxis was given. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting rabies viral RNA via real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nuchal skin biopsy and saliva specimens. Viral sequencing was consistent with a rabies virus variant found in the Mexican free-tailed bat.
