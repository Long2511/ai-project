"A 53-year-old woman presented with fever, cough, and malaise after returning from a visit to Lahore. On examination, her temperature was 38°C and she had a rash on her upper chest. A chest X-ray showed patchy basal consolidation and a full blood count revealed a relative lymphocytosis. Malaria films were negative. Blood cultures were drawn and later grew gram-negative bacilli.","[""## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.812)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis\n\n## Case 47---A-32-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-Pain_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.811)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old Malawian man with a known history of HIV, who was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis two months prior to presentation. His recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL. His past medical history is significant for treatment for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and a painfully swollen neck.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a six-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, accompanied by a painful neck swelling. Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi and had not left the country. Multi-drug resistance for TB is noted to be uncommon in this region. No other specific occupational or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, he was moderately ill, pale, and sweating with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), a pulse of 112 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing man with large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. Over the course of his hospital stay, these glands became more swollen and clearly fluctuant. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with IRIS\n\n## Case 70---A-58-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sri-Lanka-With-Fev_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.803)\n**Patient Information**: A 58-year-old woman from a rural area in Sri Lanka. No relevant comorbidities, immunosuppression, or allergies are mentioned.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of high-grade fever, chills, body aches, cough, and shortness of breath, complicated by recent onset of tinnitus, hearing loss, and increasing confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day illness characterized by high-grade fever, chills, body aches, non-productive cough, and progressive shortness of breath. Two days before admission, she developed tinnitus and hearing loss. In the 24 hours prior to admission, she became increasingly confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural area of Sri Lanka, an endemic region for scrub typhus. A crater-like lesion (eschar) was later found in her right axilla, consistent with the bite of an infected trombiculid mite (chigger), the vector for Orientia tsutsugamushi.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient's temperature was 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate was 120 bpm, and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was confused with severely impaired hearing (WHO grade 3). There were enlarged axillary lymph nodes on the right side. Lungs had scattered crackles at the bases. The liver was enlarged to 5 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen was just palpable. No rash or neck stiffness was present. A later examination on day 2 revealed a well-demarcated, crater-like eschar hidden in the right axilla.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed a normal WBC, mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98 x 10^9/L), elevated AST (74 U/L) and ALT (68 U/L), and elevated creatinine (123.8 µmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (35 cells/µL, 80% lymphocytes) with elevated protein (0.64 g/L). Blood cultures, Leptospira and Salmonella serologies, and a thick film for malaria were all negative. A chest radiograph and brain CT scan were normal, while an EEG showed widespread slowing. The diagnosis was supported by a high Orientia tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre of >1:4096.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this undifferentiated febrile illness included scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, and malaria. The clinical triad of fever, deafness, and confusion in a patient from this region strongly suggested scrub typhus. Malaria was excluded by a negative thick film, while serologies for Leptospira and Salmonella were also negative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: On the second day of admission, the patient's neurological status deteriorated with worsening confusion (GCS 8) and development of coarse tremors and saccadic eye oscillations. After an eschar was found, doxycycline therapy was commenced. The patient improved significantly within 48 hours and was discharged on day 6. Her hearing returned to normal, and she had no residual neurological deficits.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is scrub typhus, caused by infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation (fever, confusion, deafness), epidemiological risk (rural Sri Lanka), key physical finding of an eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confirmation with a high specific IFA-IgG antibody titre (>1:4096). Alternative diagnoses were ruled out by negative laboratory testing.\n**Disease Name Short**: Scrub typhus\n\n## Case 74---A-28-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sierra-Leone-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.801)\n**Patient Information**: A 28-year-old woman from eastern Sierra Leone with no prior medical history reported.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain, along with loose stools for the past 2 days. She was seen at a local health post the day prior and received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin but continued to worsen. On arrival at the hospital, her exam was notable only for mild pharyngitis. Despite treatment with IV ceftriaxone and completing the antimalarial course, her condition deteriorated. Two days after admission, she developed conjunctivitis, cough, and breathlessness, becoming very unwell and unable to walk unaided.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient presented to a small rural hospital in eastern Sierra Leone. This region is noted to have a high incidence of Lassa fever, which accounts for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some local studies. Lassa fever is a zoonosis transmitted through contact with infected rat urine.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her axillary temperature was 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 80/55 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 100 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Initial examination was unremarkable except for mild pharyngitis. As her illness progressed, she developed conjunctivitis and bilateral fine crepitations on chest auscultation.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Her initial malaria slide was negative. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood chemistry showed mild renal impairment and raised transaminases, with an aspartate transaminase (AST/GOT) of 514 U/L (normal <50 U/L). The diagnosis of Lassa fever was later confirmed with antigen testing.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included several possibilities. Adenovirus and measles can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, but adenovirus is typically mild and a rash would be expected with measles. Mycoplasma and other pneumonias do not typically cause conjunctivitis. Leptospirosis can present with non-specific fever and pulmonary involvement but usually causes conjunctival suffusion rather than conjunctivitis. Typhoid was considered, but improvement would be expected on ceftriaxone, and pharyngitis/conjunctivitis are not typical features. Lassa fever was considered highly likely given the patient's signs, symptoms, and location in an endemic area.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin without improvement. At the hospital, she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and completed her antimalarial course, but continued to deteriorate. After Lassa fever was confirmed by antigen testing, she was moved to a specialist isolation unit and received IV ribavirin. Strict infection control measures were implemented. Unfortunately, she was already very unwell and died 2 days later. Public health follow-up was initiated for all family, friends, and medical staff contacts.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was Lassa fever, a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by an arenavirus. This was confirmed by a positive antigen test. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of a severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, renal impairment, and elevated liver transaminases, which was refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials. The patient's presence in eastern Sierra Leone, a highly endemic area, provided strong epidemiological evidence. The patient succumbed to the illness despite late initiation of IV ribavirin.\n**Disease Name Short**: Lassa fever""]","Diagnosis: Malaria
Reason: The patient presented with fever, cough, and malaise, which are common symptoms of malaria. The presence of a rash on the upper chest and a chest X-ray showing patchy basal consolidation are also consistent with malaria. The negative malaria films and blood cultures further support the diagnosis of malaria.","The diagnosis is enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile illness, rash, and relative lymphocytosis after returning from an endemic area (Lahore). The diagnosis was confirmed by the isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood cultures.",0.40429254217481303,0.45454545454545453,0.0

He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.812)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease\n\n## Case 54---A-52-Year-Old-Male-Safari-Tourist-Returning-fro_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.810)\n**Patient Information**: A 52-year-old man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever for two days, accompanied by night sweats and a frontal headache.\n**History Of Present Illness**: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and frontal headache. He denied any joint pains or rash. The symptoms developed ten days after returning from a trip to South Africa.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday trip to South Africa, which concluded 10 days prior to presentation. His travel included visiting Cape Town, the Garden Route, KwaZulu-Natal, and going on safari in Kruger Park and other game reserves. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.\n**Vitals**: On examination, after having taken 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5°C (99.5°F). His pulse was 80 bpm and his blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was in fair general condition, with no jaundice and a supple neck. There were enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin. A small necrotic skin lesion (eschar), about 0.7 cm in diameter, was noted on his left upper thigh, with surrounding inflammation, lymphangiitis, and adjoining lymphadenitis.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin blood films for malaria, were both negative. The text notes that PCR from an eschar scab can confirm the diagnosis, but does not state if this was performed.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was African tick-bite fever, based on the typical eschar and recent travel history to an endemic safari region. Malaria was a critical differential diagnosis that needed to be ruled out, as the patient was a febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region (KwaZulu-Natal) without having taken chemoprophylaxis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was prescribed doxycycline 100 mg twice daily by mouth for one week. Following treatment, the fever settled within a few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after approximately two weeks.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was African tick-bite fever, a rickettsial disease caused by Rickettsia africae. The diagnosis was made clinically, based on the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and a history of safari travel in an endemic region of Southern Africa. Malaria, a key differential diagnosis, was excluded by negative rapid diagnostic tests and blood smears.\n**Disease Name Short**: African tick-bite fever\n\n## Case 92---A-42-Year-Old-Traveller-Returning-from-Thaila_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.805)\n**Patient Information**: A 42-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history. He had not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis for his recent trip, which was in line with his home country's recommendations.\n**Chief Complaint**: A six-day history of fever up to 40°C, arthralgias, and retro-orbital pain.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past six days, the patient has experienced a fever reaching 40°C (104°F), along with joint pain (arthralgias) and retro-orbital pain. The symptoms began during a trip to Thailand, and he presented to a hospital in Germany the day after his return.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient returned from a 10-week trip to Thailand the day before presentation. His travel included 2 months on Little Koh Chang in the Andaman Sea, 5 days in Hua Hin at the Gulf of Thailand, and 5 days in Bangkok. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.\n**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 39.1°C (102.4°F), blood pressure was 156/80 mmHg, pulse was 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 was 95% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert with a GCS of 15/15. There was no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation was clear. The abdominal examination was benign, showing no tenderness on palpation and no organomegaly.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 81 × 10^9/L, an elevated CRP of 55 mg/L, and elevated liver enzymes (AST 62 U/L, ALT 106 U/L). A dengue NS1 antigen test and a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (detecting P. falciparum HRP-II and panmalarial aldolase) were both negative. Subsequent investigation with a thick blood film revealed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. A species-specific PCR later confirmed a mono-infection with P. knowlesi.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was dengue fever, given the syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, and thrombocytopenia after travel to Thailand. However, the dengue NS1 test was negative. Other arboviral infections like Chikungunya and Zika were also considered. Influenza, acute HIV infection, and enteric fever were other possibilities. Malaria was a crucial consideration that had to be ruled out in any febrile traveler from an endemic area, as thrombocytopenia is a hallmark feature and rapid tests can be falsely negative, especially for non-falciparum species.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Based on the suspicion of non-falciparum malaria, treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (250/100mg), four tablets once daily for three days. The patient responded well to treatment, recovered rapidly, and was discharged on the fourth day.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Knowlesi malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi. Although initial rapid tests for malaria and dengue were negative, a microscopic examination of a thick blood film revealed Plasmodium trophozoites. The specific species was then definitively identified as P. knowlesi by a species-specific PCR test. The diagnosis is consistent with the patient's travel history to Southeast Asia, clinical presentation of high fever and thrombocytopenia, and rapid response to appropriate antimalarial therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Knowlesi malaria""]","Diagnosis: Plasmodium falciparum malaria
Reason: The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with malaria, including the fever, rigors, and profuse sweating. The patient also reported taking anti-malarial tablets during her trip, which is a common symptom of malaria.

Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.818)\n**Patient Information**: A 7-year-old girl from South Sudan, described as severely malnourished with a Z-score less than -3. She has never been admitted to a hospital before the current illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-week history of undulating fever.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient's uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative. An initial visceral leishmaniasis rK39-antibody RDT was also negative. However, a subsequent Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis was positive with a high titre (≥1:6,400).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient's positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\n**Disease Name Short**: Visceral leishmaniasis\n\n## Case 29---A-35-Year-Old-Woman-from-Malawi-With-Feve_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.808)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Malawian woman, divorced with three children aged 17, 15, and 12. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables. The patient was newly diagnosed with HIV and noted to be wasted with a BMI of 17 kg/m². She had a history of progressive weakness for several months despite taking iron tablets prescribed two months prior.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever and weakness, with fever starting 3 days prior to presentation.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 3-day history of fever, superimposed on progressive weakness that had worsened over several months. She reported some weight loss but denied cough, night sweats, diarrhea, dysuria, or any abnormal bleeding. Two months earlier, she had sought care for weakness, was noted to be clinically pale, and was prescribed iron tablets, but her weakness continued to progress.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi, a high-prevalence setting for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables. She is divorced, and her three children are well. Her children and past/current sexual partners were later encouraged to be tested for HIV.\n**Vitals**: On admission, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm, temperature was 37.8°C (100°F), respiratory rate was 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air. Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared wasted (BMI 17 kg/m²) with very pale conjunctivae and no jaundice. Examination of her mouth was normal, with no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, or oral hairy leukoplakia. Her chest was clear. The abdomen was soft with slight diffuse tenderness and no guarding. The spleen was palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. The rectal examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial investigations showed a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test and a positive HIV serology. The full blood count revealed leukopenia (WBC 3.0 x 10^9/L), severe anaemia (Haemoglobin 4.8 mg/dL), a normal MCV (90 fL), and borderline low platelets (112 x 10^9/L). Subsequent blood cultures grew Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium. Tuberculosis screening revealed prominent hilar lymph nodes.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary suspected diagnosis was invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection, given the septic presentation without a clear focus in a newly diagnosed, wasted, and anemic HIV-positive patient. Other considerations included enteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid), which are clinically indistinguishable but less common. Tuberculosis was also a strong possibility, particularly as a cause for severe anaemia. Visceral leishmaniasis was considered but thought unlikely as it is not endemic in Malawi and the patient lacked gross hepatosplenomegaly.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initiated on IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily and fluid resuscitation after blood cultures were drawn. Upon culture results, her antibiotics were changed to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg three times daily for 14 days. She was also commenced on antituberculous treatment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, vitamin B6, and therapeutic feeding. She was discharged after 4 weeks and at a 3-month follow-up was feeling better, had gained weight, and her hemoglobin levels were improving.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection, with the causative agent identified as Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium by blood culture. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of sepsis with fever, severe anaemia, and splenomegaly in the context of newly diagnosed, advanced HIV infection. Concomitant tuberculosis was also suspected due to radiologic findings and the high-risk setting, and treatment was initiated accordingly.\n**Disease Name Short**: Invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) Infection\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.807)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis""]","Diagnosis: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)
Reason: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), which is characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and loss of appetite, as well as progressive hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. The patient's history of a camping trip in a coastal area of Spain, where he saw many thin dogs, is also consistent with the epidemiology of schistosomiasis. The patient's age and the presence of pancytopenia are also consistent with the clinical presentation of acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome).","The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis, likely caused by Leishmania infantum. This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of prolonged fever, massive hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia in a patient with relevant epidemiologic exposure. The patient had recently been camping in southern Spain, a known endemic area, and was exposed to dogs, which are a primary reservoir. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Leishmania on a bone marrow sample.",0.6974181113638374,0.7142857142857143,0.9999999999
"A 24-year-old man presents after a 3-month backpacking trip to India. He initially developed watery, non-bloody diarrhea which resolved, and a stool culture at that time grew Campylobacter. Two weeks after returning home, he developed recurrent diarrhea, loss of appetite, bloating, and significant flatulence. He notes that his stools are particularly foul-smelling and difficult to flush. The patient has also started to lose weight. His doctor ordered stool microscopy to investigate for ova, cysts, and parasites.

No other significant medical history is mentioned.\n**Chief Complaint**: Passage of loose stools, four or five episodes per day, with flatulence for the past two weeks.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past two weeks, the patient experienced four to five episodes of loose stools daily, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping on defecation. Over the last three days, he noted bloating, distension, and an urge to pass stool after consuming milk products. He had mild nausea but no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin that ended two days prior, they became mushy, greasy, foul-smelling, and occurred three to four times per day.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had been backpacking in India for the month prior to seeking medical care in Chinglepet, Tamil Nadu. His symptoms are consistent with an infection acquired during travel in a region where giardiasis is common, typically transmitted via contaminated water or food.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other specific vital signs are documented, but the clinical findings state 'no signs of dehydration' and 'the rest of the examination is normal'.\n**Physical Exam**: Clinical findings included mild, non-specific abdominal tenderness. There were no signs of dehydration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Stool analysis was positive for reducing substances. Microscopic stool examination for enteric parasites was confirmatory, revealing Giardia trophozoites in the fresh specimen and Giardia cysts on formol-ether concentrated specimens.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The case text does not explicitly detail a differential diagnosis. The diagnosis was established directly from stool microscopy, which is confirmatory for giardiasis. The clinical picture of protracted, non-febrile, malabsorptive diarrhea in a traveler from an endemic region is highly suggestive of this etiology.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received a single 2g oral dose of tinidazole and was advised to restrict milk and high-sugar products for two weeks. He was also counseled on food and water safety. At a follow-up visit three days later, his stool consistency had normalized, frequency had decreased, and anorexia and nausea had resolved. He reported feeling much better, despite some transient bloating after inadvertently consuming a milk-based dessert.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the parasite Giardia intestinalis (G. lamblia). This was confirmed by the direct visualization of both Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and carbohydrate malabsorption (indicated by positive stool reducing substances) after travel in India is characteristic of the infection.\n**Disease Name Short**: Giardiasis\n\n## Case 79---A-34-Year-Old-Male-Immigrant-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.813)\n**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old man, originally from northern Peru, who has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He has a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively. His Peruvian wife and children are reported as healthy at presentation.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea with colicky abdominal pain and a weight loss of approximately 20 kg.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. For over 12 years, he has suffered from recurrent, less severe episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but the frequency of these episodes has increased over the past 2 years.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is an immigrant from northern Peru, a tropical region described as highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. He has resided in Chile for the last 9 years. His family history is notable for two close relatives (mother and brother) dying from wasting syndromes of unknown origin. Later investigation revealed his wife had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and was also HTLV-1 positive; one of his two children also had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection but was HTLV-1 negative.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient is cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass, a body weight of 44 kg, and a BMI of 17. Abdominal examination revealed slight pain on palpation. Otherwise, the physical examination was normal, with no fever, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable lymphadenopathy, and no peripheral oedema.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis (WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L), thrombocytosis (platelets 644 x 10^9/L), mild anemia (haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (protein 4.9 g/dL), and an elevated ESR (26 mm/h). An HIV test was negative. Abdominal CT and MRI scans were without pathological findings, and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was macroscopically normal. However, histology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Subsequent Baermann testing of a fresh stool sample demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis, and larvae were also found in respiratory secretions. Serology confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea and wasting in this patient centered on helminth infections. The two main considerations were Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium or Cystoisospora belli were also a possibility, though less likely in an HIV-negative patient. Given the patient's origin from a region highly endemic for S. stercoralis, this was considered the most probable cause.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. Following the diagnosis, he was treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day for 7 days), which was repeated after a 2-week interval. He recovered from his diarrhea and abdominal symptoms within weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, he had gained 13 kg, was free of postprandial cramps for the first time in over 10 years, and parasitological examination was negative. His wife and one child were also found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and were presumably treated.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann technique) and respiratory secretions. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a known risk factor, HTLV-1 co-infection (confirmed by serology), and the patient's geographic origin from an endemic area. The clinical picture of severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, along with the dramatic response to ivermectin, solidified the diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome\n\n## Case 58---A-25-Year-Old-Woman-from-Egypt-With-Severe-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.789)\n**Patient Information**: A 25-year-old woman from Bani Suwaif in Upper Egypt. No pre-existing comorbidities were reported.\n**Chief Complaint**: Severe diarrhoea for 2 months accompanied by significant weight loss (15 kg) and amenorrhoea.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, later progressing to anorexia and vomiting. She experienced voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. She had received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Bani Suwaif, Upper Egypt, which is an endemic area for Capillaria philippinensis. The text notes that capillariasis is transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which is the likely source of her infection.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally unwell, pale, and had angular stomatitis. Examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory findings showed electrolyte derangements with hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (127 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (2.1 mmol/L), and severe hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/L). Additional results included mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL), mild eosinophilia (0.53 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine (115 µmol/L). A D-xylose test showed evidence of malabsorption. The diagnosis was confirmed by stool microscopy, which detected numerous peanut-shaped helminth ova characteristic of Capillaria philippinensis.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the chronic diarrhoea, initial considerations likely included other infectious causes, as suggested by the empiric but unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics like metronidazole. However, the definitive finding of helminth ova on stool microscopy established a parasitic etiology.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the hospital and initiated on albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. She also received supportive care including oral and parenteral fluids and electrolytes for resuscitation, a high-protein diet, and vitamins. During the first days of treatment, numerous adult helminths were found in stool samples. Her general condition improved significantly within the first week, vomiting stopped, and the diarrhoea subsided after two weeks of treatment.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. This was confirmed by the microscopic identification of typical peanut-shaped ova in the patient's stool. The clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and signs of malabsorption (pitting oedema, hypoalbuminemia) in a patient from an endemic region is classic for this infection. The parasite's unique ability to multiply within the host via an autoinfection cycle explains the severe and long-lasting nature of the illness. The patient's positive response to albendazole therapy further supports the diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Intestinal capillariasis\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.772)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic.

Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with IRIS\n\n## Case 23---A-31-Year-Old-HIV-Positive-Business-Traveller-W_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.802)\n**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old HIV-positive man, diagnosed 6 years prior, who is not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. His CD4 count one month before presentation was 280/μL, and on admission was 150/µL. He denies recreational drug use and has never smoked tobacco, with no other significant past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath, dry cough, and drenching night sweats.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10 kg over the past 5 months. At presentation, he was short of breath at rest but able to complete full sentences.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in London and travels extensively for business, with work trips in the past 6 months to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. He lives with his male partner. No other specific exposures were mentioned.\n**Vitals**: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation (sO2) of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of O2.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert but short of breath at rest. Auscultation of the chest was clear. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Arterial blood gas on ambient air showed respiratory failure with a PaO2 of 7.6 kPa. The full blood count, creatinine, urea, and liver function tests were normal. CRP was slightly elevated at 6.7 mg/dL. His CD4 count was 150/µL, and his HIV viral load was 1,500,000 copies/mL. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral perihilar infiltrates, and a chest CT showed extensive 'ground-glass' infiltrates with no pulmonary emboli. Serum β-D-glucan was >500 pg/mL. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with Grocott staining revealing Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms and a strongly positive PCR for P. jirovecii DNA.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: Given the patient was ART-naïve and HIV-positive with a low CD4 count, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was the leading differential. Other possibilities considered included tuberculosis, atypical bacterial pneumonia, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis, particularly in light of his extensive travel. Pulmonary embolism was also considered due to recent long-haul flights but was ruled out by CT scan.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received high-flow oxygen, high-dose intravenous co-trimoxazole, and prednisolone. He commenced antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) ten days into treatment. Two weeks into his course, he developed a drug rash, which prompted a switch of PCP treatment to clindamycin and primaquine to complete a 21-day total course. His ART was also changed. His hypoxia resolved, and he was discharged on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was made in an ART-naïve, HIV-positive man presenting with subacute respiratory failure, profound hypoxia, and a low CD4 count (150/µL). It was supported by classic 'ground-glass' infiltrates on chest CT and a highly elevated serum β-D-glucan level, and was definitively confirmed by finding *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and positive PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n**Disease Name Short**: Pneumocystis pneumonia\n\n## Case 55---A-40-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.794)\n**Patient Information**: A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously, and a recent HIV ELISA test was negative. The patient denies recent travels.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, and significant weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized for similar complaints, at which time three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical and radiographic findings, and he was started on first-line TB therapy. Despite adherence, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistent cough that developed streaking of blood, leading to a referral for suspected multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB).\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from a rural area in the Peruvian Amazon. His occupation and geographic origin are relevant for endemic fungal infections. He denies recent travels.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg, pulse was 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared fatigued and cachectic. Examination revealed a few small, mobile, soft, non-tender cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes. Auscultation of the lungs found bilateral crackles and rhonchi. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed significant thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 1093 × 10^9/L; the rest of the full blood count was normal. Two repeated AFB smears and a tuberculin skin test were negative. A chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates, predominantly in the central and upper zones, with multiple cavities in the right lung and no hilar lymphadenopathy. Examination of a sputum potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed the characteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and the organism was subsequently grown in culture.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses considered were MDR TB, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. TB is highly endemic in Peru, making it a necessary consideration. Histoplasmosis can mimic TB symptoms. However, paracoccidioidomycosis was deemed most likely given the patient's age, gender, occupation (farmer), geographic origin (Peruvian Amazon), and clinical presentation, which are all typical for the chronic form of this mycosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial treatment with first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was ineffective. After the definitive diagnosis was made, TB treatment was discontinued. Due to the extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole. The thrombocytosis was considered a reactive process to the chronic infection.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. It was confirmed by the visualization of characteristic yeast forms on a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, with subsequent isolation in fungal culture. The clinical picture, including the failure to respond to empiric TB therapy and the patient's specific demographic and exposure profile as a farmer from the Peruvian Amazon, strongly supported this diagnosis over tuberculosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Paracoccidioidomycosis\n\n## Case 33---A-53-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-C_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical- (score=0.791)\n**Patient Information**: A 53-year-old Malawian man, who is a non-smoker with an unremarkable past medical history. He was newly diagnosed with HIV infection and found to have advanced immunosuppression, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL.\n**Chief Complaint**: Productive cough for 3 months with associated night sweats and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of productive cough with whitish sputum, night sweats, and unquantified weight loss. Two months prior, he sought care for the same complaints and was treated with presumptive antimalarials and a 5-day course of amoxicillin, with no improvement in his symptoms. He is not on any regular medication.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a subsistence farmer in Malawi. He reports no known tuberculosis (TB) contacts and has no history of working in mines or the construction industry. He is married with five children, who are all well.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 88 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared slightly wasted and mildly anaemic. Examination of the mouth revealed no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma, or oral hairy leukoplakia. His chest was clear to auscultation, and heart sounds were normal without murmurs. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the liver and spleen were not enlarged.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The HIV test was reactive, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL. Laboratory results showed leukopenia (WBC 3.2 x 10^9/L) and anemia (Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), with normal platelets. Two sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, as were a Malaria RDT and a thick smear for Plasmodium spp. A chest radiograph on admission showed a prominent hilar region bilaterally but was otherwise normal. Induced sputum was also negative for AFB, and sputum PCR was not available.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The most likely diagnosis was smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's HIV-positive status with advanced immunosuppression, chronic constitutional symptoms, and lack of response to antibiotics. Other considerations included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a bacterial chest infection, and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, although the latter was less likely without cutaneous or mucosal lesions. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) was also considered.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole, but his fever persisted. On hospital day 7, he was started on empirical treatment for smear-negative TB with a four-drug regimen (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). After one week of antituberculous therapy, he began to feel better, his fever resolved, and the cough gradually settled. Three weeks into his TB treatment, he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with advanced HIV infection. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, and fever in a severely immunosuppressed individual (CD4 count 54), which is a common presentation for TB in this setting. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's prompt clinical response to empirical antituberculous treatment after failing to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Negative sputum smears and non-specific radiographic findings (hilar prominence) are typical for HIV-associated TB.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculosis (HIV-associated)""]","Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (TB)
Reason: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and cough are consistent with a diagnosis of TB. The presence of bilateral nodular infiltrates on the chest radiograph and the finding of yeast forms in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are characteristic of TB. Additionally, the patient's medical history of rheumatoid arthritis and the use of methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and infliximab suggest a high risk of TB, as these medications can increase the risk of TB in patients with underlying immune compromise. The patient's rapid progression to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation also supports the diagnosis of TB.","The diagnosis is histoplasmosis, caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This is supported by the patient's severe respiratory failure, bilateral nodular infiltrates on chest imaging, and residence in an endemic area (Ohio). His immunosuppressive therapy, particularly the TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab, is a major risk factor for severe disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying yeast forms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a positive Histoplasma urine antigen test, and subsequent confirmation by culture and high complement fixation titers.",0.6238973626613848,0.26666666666666666,0.9999999999
"A staff sergeant was hospitalized after returning from a military exercise in Belize. He initially presented with fever, headache, and myalgia, but after a brief improvement, his condition deteriorated. He developed jaundice, signs of pneumonia, conjunctival inflammation, and hepatosplenomegaly. A chest X-ray showed bi-basal opacities. Laboratory results revealed neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, elevated conjugated bilirubin, and mild elevation of transaminases. His condition progressed to oliguria and uremia, requiring renal support.","[""## Case 93---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Logger-from-Peru-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.800)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Peruvian man, born in Lima, with a past medical history of hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years prior. He has not received any vaccinations since early childhood and has not taken any malaria prophylaxis.\n**Chief Complaint**: Referred from a local hospital for fever, jaundice, bleeding, and altered mental status, eight days after symptom onset.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever and retro-orbital headache eight days before referral. Two days into the illness, his condition worsened with the onset of jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria, and increasing mental obtundation, leading to admission at a local jungle hospital. During his transfer to the referral hospital in Lima, he experienced a generalized seizure.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: For the past five years, the patient has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River, which forms the Amazon River. This occupation in an endemic region of Peru exposed him to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. He was unvaccinated against relevant regional diseases.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands, and intermittently stuporous with marked flapping of hands (asterixis). He was jaundiced, with spontaneous bleeding from his oral mucosa and at IV sites, and had multiple large ecchymoses on his face, trunk, and limbs. Lung auscultation revealed crepitant rales in both bases. The liver was enlarged and felt 3 cm below the right costal margin, but the spleen was not palpable and there was no lymphadenopathy. There were no focal neurological or meningeal signs.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed anaemia (haematocrit 30%), mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 110,000/μL), and a normal white cell count. There was severe hepatocellular injury with AST 2890 U/L and ALT 2676 U/L, cholestasis with total bilirubin 11.6 mg/dL, and coagulopathy with an INR of 2.6 and aPTT of 80s. Acute kidney injury was present (Urea 89 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 50-60 RBCs/field. Malaria thick films (x3), blood cultures, Brucella serology, and Hepatitis B IgM anti-HBc were all negative. IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever was highly positive (1:10000), while anti-dengue IgM was negative. A chest x-ray later showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Subsequent labs showed worsening renal failure and a sudden drop in liver transaminases.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for this acute febrile illness with liver failure included severe malaria, though transaminases were atypically high. Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and toxic hepatitis were considered. Leptospirosis was less likely due to the extreme elevation of transaminases. Typhoid and brucellosis were also possibilities. Severe dengue was considered, but the prolonged fever, prominent jaundice, and low haematocrit made it less probable. Given his occupation and lack of vaccination in an endemic area, yellow fever was a primary concern among other viral haemorrhagic fevers.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received supportive care along with presumptive treatment for malaria and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite this, his condition rapidly deteriorated over the next three days with worsening hepatic encephalopathy, progressive renal failure, coma, and DIC with increased spontaneous bleeding. He developed ARDS. Laboratory results showed worsening kidney function and a sudden drop in liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatic disintegration. The patient passed away one day later, on the fourth day of admission to the Lima hospital.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe, fatal yellow fever. This was confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever with a titer of 1:10000. The clinical presentation of fever, jaundice, bleeding, and multi-organ failure (liver, kidney, lungs) in an unvaccinated logger working in an endemic region of the Peruvian Amazon is classic for the disease. Other considerations like malaria, dengue, and bacterial sepsis were less likely given the clinical picture and negative diagnostic tests. The terminal drop in transaminases was consistent with near-total destruction of hepatocytes.\n**Disease Name Short**: Yellow fever\n\n## Case 27---A-16-Year-Old-Boy-from-Sri-Lanka-With-Fever_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.793)\n**Patient Information**: A 16-year-old Sri Lankan boy who was attending school until the onset of his illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches for 2 days, with anuria for the preceding 12 hours.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented to a local hospital with a 2-day history of fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches. During this illness, he had vomited two to three times and had not passed any urine for the 12 hours prior to presentation. He reported no cough, coryza, or shortness of breath.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Sri Lanka. Five days before falling ill, he had been fishing in an urban water stream.\n**Vitals**: On clinical examination, his temperature was 38.3°C (100.9°F), the pulse rate was 100 bpm (low in volume), and his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The boy appeared ill, drowsy, jaundiced, and had subconjunctival haemorrhages. There was severe muscle tenderness, mainly involving the abdominal wall and calves, making it difficult for him to walk. The liver was palpable 4cm below the right costal margin and was tender. Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness was present. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Examination of the heart and lungs was normal, and the neurological examination was also normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia (platelets 96 ×10⁹/L) and acute renal failure (blood urea nitrogen 20.7 µmol/L, serum creatinine 212.2 µmol/L). Liver function tests showed cholestatic jaundice with a total bilirubin of 77 µmol/L and direct bilirubin of 54.7 µmol/L, along with mildly elevated AST (64 IU/L) and ALT (58 IU/L). C-reactive protein was elevated at 48 mg/L. The white blood cell count was normal at 5.7 ×10⁹/L. Urine microscopy showed 20 red blood cells per high-power field, protein '+', and granular casts '+'. A chest radiograph was normal and an ECG showed sinus tachycardia.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was leptospirosis, given the presentation of acute febrile illness with jaundice, renal failure, and a history of exposure to potentially contaminated water. Other diagnoses considered included scrub typhus, which can present similarly but often involves an eschar and lymphadenopathy; hantavirus infection, due to its similar epidemiology; and dengue haemorrhagic fever, in which acute kidney injury and jaundice are uncommon.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Severe leptospirosis was suspected, and the patient was started on empirical benzylpenicillin. Despite rehydration, he developed acute renal failure requiring haemodialysis (HD). His hospital course was complicated by myocarditis and atrial fibrillation, but he tolerated further HD sessions. The patient gradually recovered over 10 days with intensive care management.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe leptospirosis, presenting as Weil's syndrome. This is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, cholestatic jaundice, and acute renal failure, along with findings of subconjunctival haemorrhage, severe myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is further corroborated by the clear epidemiological link of fishing in an urban stream five days prior to symptom onset. Although specific diagnostic tests were not detailed, the clinical suspicion was high, and the patient's recovery following empirical antibiotic therapy and intensive supportive care, including dialysis, aligns with this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Leptospirosis\n\n## Case 39---A-30-Year-Old-Male-Chinese-Trader-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.789)\n**Patient Information**: A 30-year-old male Chinese itinerant trader with no other reported comorbidities.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 7-day history of fever, chills, headache and a dry cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed slide-positive falciparum malaria while living in southern Laos and self-treated with intravenous and intramuscular artemether 80 mg for 5 days, using medication he brought from China. He did not improve; the fever persisted, he developed jaundice, and was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Vientiane for further management.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient was an itinerant trader living in southern Laos, a region endemic for falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant strains, as well as other infections like scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis. His exposure was to a substandard antimalarial drug he had brought from China.\n**Vitals**: On admission to the hospital in Vientiane, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F). His blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score were reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Clinical findings on admission included nausea, dry cough, moderate dehydration, chest pain, and abdominal tenderness. His chest was clear on auscultation, and no hepatosplenomegaly was detected.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: On admission, a Giemsa smear was negative for malaria parasites, but a rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2) was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Serum creatinine and glucose were normal. Liver function tests were elevated with an ALT of 301 U/L, AST of 230 U/L, and ALP of 470 U/L. Total bilirubin was 14 µmol/L and direct bilirubin was 6.4 µmol/L. Subsequent analysis of the artemether he had used showed it was substandard, containing only 59 mg, which was 74% of the stated dose.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnoses considered for the persistent fever included bacterial co-infection (especially Salmonella), another common infectious disease from Laos (such as scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, or dengue fever), or failure of malaria treatment. Potential causes for treatment failure included artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, incorrect dosing, or the use of a poor-quality antimalarial drug.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After failing to improve on a 5-day course of self-administered artemether, the patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate 10 mg/kg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for a duration of 7 days. His fever resolved 35 hours after starting this new therapy, and he was discharged well. Investigations found no evidence of any other infections.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was treatment failure of falciparum malaria due to the use of a substandard medication. The initial malaria infection was confirmed by a positive HRP-2 test, despite a negative smear post-treatment. The failure to respond to the initial 5-day course of artemether was determined to be caused by the poor quality of the drug, which chemical analysis revealed was significantly underdosed (74% of stated content). The patient's rapid clinical resolution with a standard course of quality-assured quinine and doxycycline supported this conclusion over drug resistance or a co-infection.\n**Disease Name Short**: Falciparum malaria\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.788)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease""]","Diagnosis: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
Reason: The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's fever, headache, myalgia, and pneumonia are typical symptoms of PCP. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly, oliguria, and uremia are also characteristic of PCP. The patient's age and primary symptoms are also consistent with PCP, which is more common in the elderly and immunocompromised.","The diagnosis is Weil's disease, a severe form of leptospirosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of potential exposure during a military exercise in an endemic area (Belize). The clinical presentation of a biphasic illness progressing to jaundice, renal failure (oliguria, uremia), pneumonia, and conjunctival inflammation is classic for this condition. Key laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin, and uremia.",0.20727391925961083,0.0,0.9999999999
"A 25-year-old male was hospitalized for vomiting blood. On examination, he was found to have an enlarged liver and spleen, and endoscopy confirmed the presence of esophageal varices. Blood tests revealed anemia and a significantly elevated eosinophil count. Serological tests for hepatitis B and C were negative, and the patient denied excessive alcohol use. A liver biopsy showed extensive granulomatous changes and fibrosis. Further history revealed he spent his childhood in Kenya where he frequently swam in a lake.

He comes from a poor family, was initially unable to read or write, and had no other reported comorbidities. He was referred from a haematology department where a work-up for his condition was inconclusive.\n**Chief Complaint**: Referral for splenomegaly and bicytopenia; the patient reports intermittent fever and a feeling of ""heaviness"" on the left side of his abdomen.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports intermittent fever and abdominal heaviness on the left side for some time, though the exact duration is difficult to specify. He is otherwise clinically well, with no night sweats and a stable weight. An initial work-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at an outside department did not establish a diagnosis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a migrant from rural Mali who arrived in Germany one year prior to presentation. His journey included crossing Niger, spending several weeks in a detention center in Libya, and traveling through Italy to Germany. His origin in rural Mali constitutes significant exposure to stable malaria transmission.\n**Vitals**: At presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.98°F), blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a pulse of 64 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared clinically well. The main finding was a massively enlarged spleen palpated 15 cm below the left costal margin. There was no clinical anaemia or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac sounds were clear with no murmurs. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed splenomegaly with a spleen measuring 21.8 cm in longitudinal diameter with a homogenous parenchyma. The liver was normal in size, and flow in the portal and splenic veins was normal. There was no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial labs revealed a mild bicytopenia (WBC 3.3 x10⁹/L, Platelets 124 x10⁹/L). A key finding was a markedly elevated IgM of 8.59 g/L (reference range 0.4-2.3). Inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR were normal. Thick and thin blood films for Plasmodium were negative. However, P. falciparum indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was positive with a titer of 1:256. Further investigation with a PCR for P. falciparum DNA came back positive. Serologies for HIV, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis were all negative, as were blood cultures.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), supported by massive splenomegaly, very high IgM, positive malaria serology, and origin from an endemic area. Other possibilities were considered and deemed less likely: lymphoma/leukemia (due to normal differential count and LDH), visceral leishmaniasis (patient not severely ill), and schistosomiasis (normal liver on ultrasound).\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. His reported episodes of fever subsequently subsided. Malaria PCR was still positive two weeks later but remained negative thereafter. He was monitored for 2.5 years, during which his IgM levels normalized (over 2 years) and his spleen size slowly decreased to 14 cm. The patient remained well and was permitted to stay in Germany after a medical letter was issued regarding the risk of splenic rupture if deported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS). This was confirmed in a patient from a malaria-endemic area (rural Mali) presenting with massive splenomegaly, bicytopenia, and exceptionally high polyclonal IgM. Although peripheral blood smears were negative, the diagnosis was supported by positive P. falciparum serology (IFAT 1:256) and definitively established by a positive P. falciparum PCR. The diagnosis was further solidified by the excellent clinical response (resolution of fever) and immunological/radiological improvement (slow decrease in IgM and spleen size) following a single course of antimalarial therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly\n\n## Case 20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.819)\n**Patient Information**: A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation. He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 67---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Peruvian-Andes-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro (score=0.805)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from the highlands of Peru who was previously healthy. She is single and has no children.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of upper abdominal pain and weight loss, with a 2-week history of intermittent fevers.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain, a 5 kg weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, complicated by intermittent fevers for the past 2 weeks. Analgesics did not control her pain. Three days prior, she was evaluated in an emergency room where an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic liver lesions. She was treated empirically for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses with ceftriaxone and metronidazole but showed no clinical improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in the highlands of Peru. Approximately 2 to 3 months before her illness, she changed to a vegetarian diet and began consuming energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. She also started taking over-the-counter medicines for weight loss.\n**Vitals**: On admission, her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg, pulse was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared ill and had pale mucous membranes but no jaundice. Palpation of the abdomen revealed right upper quadrant tenderness. The liver was slightly enlarged with a span of 15 cm. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission were notable for a WBC count of 13.94 x 10^9/L with pronounced eosinophilia at 43% (total eosinophil count 5.97). Hemoglobin was 12.3 g/dL. Liver function tests showed a mildly elevated ALT at 55 U/L and an elevated alkaline phosphatase at 170 U/L. An abdominal ultrasound and a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen both demonstrated multiple liver lesions, described as hypoechoic and hypodense, non-enhancing, respectively. A subsequent Fas2 ELISA test was positive with a titre of 0.56 (normal <0.2).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial working diagnosis was pyogenic liver abscess, but this was considered less likely after the patient failed to improve with 3 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Fascioliasis became the primary consideration due to the patient\'s origin from the Andes, high eosinophilia, and history of consuming alfalfa and watercress. Amoebic liver abscess was also considered, but the presence of multiple lesions and significant eosinophilia made it less typical. Other endemic infections such as brucellosis and visceral toxocariasis were also on the differential.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After failing to respond to an initial course of ceftriaxone and metronidazole, the patient received a single 10 mg/kg dose of triclabendazole upon suspicion of fascioliasis. Following this treatment, her clinical symptoms rapidly improved, her laboratory parameters normalized, and follow-up imaging showed that her liver lesions were disappearing.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute fascioliasis, caused by the liver fluke *Fasciola hepatica*. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical presentation of fever and abdominal pain, pronounced eosinophilia, and a classic epidemiological link of consuming watercress in an endemic area (Peruvian Andes). The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive Fas2 ELISA serology test, and further substantiated by the rapid clinical and radiological resolution of symptoms and liver lesions after treatment with triclabendazole.\n**Disease Name Short**: Fascioliasis\n\n## Case 44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.805)\n**Patient Information**: A 7-year-old girl from South Sudan, described as severely malnourished with a Z-score less than -3. She has never been admitted to a hospital before the current illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-week history of undulating fever.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient\'s uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative. An initial visceral leishmaniasis rK39-antibody RDT was also negative. However, a subsequent Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis was positive with a high titre (≥1:6,400).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient\'s condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient\'s positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\n**Disease Name Short**: Visceral leishmaniasis']","Diagnosis: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)
Reason: The patient's history of frequent swimming in a lake in Kenya, along with the presence of esophageal varices and granulomatous changes in the liver biopsy, are consistent with the clinical presentation of acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome). The patient's age and the absence of other known risk factors for schistosomiasis, such as travel to endemic areas, also support this diagnosis.","The diagnosis is chronic schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This is supported by the patient's history of childhood freshwater exposure in Kenya, which led to the development of portal hypertension with hepatosplenomegaly and bleeding esophageal varices. The marked eosinophilia and granulomatous fibrosis on liver biopsy are also classic findings. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying S. mansoni eggs in the stool and on rectal biopsy, with positive serology providing further evidence.",0.4811999503231596,0.25,0.0
"A 24-year-old man from Southern India presented with swelling of his left foot that diminishes overnight. He is afebrile and systemically well but reports a history of recurrent episodes of painful, swollen lymph nodes in his groin. On examination, he has enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was significant for a marked eosinophilia of 1.4×10^9 L–1, while D-dimers were normal. Filarial serology was positive. The patient noted that in his hometown, he had seen individuals with grossly swollen legs.

HIV antibody testing was negative. He has no other reported significant medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A mobile, itchy mass under the skin, which has been migrating for three weeks.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Three weeks ago, the patient first noted a mass in his groin that subsided after four days. He then developed an itchy, serpiginous rash that tracked from his groin to his chest, moved over several days, and then disappeared. The mass subsequently reappeared on his right shoulder, prompting him to seek assessment. There was no history of fever or systemic illness.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Five weeks prior to presentation, the patient returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. During the trip, he swam in fresh river water and ate freshwater fish from the river, which he later admitted included making sushi. Two of the four friends who accompanied him had the same complaint. The patient took malaria chemoprophylaxis and slept under a mosquito net. He denies any sexual contact on the trip.\n**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Organ system examination was normal. On his right upper deltoid, there was a firm mass with clear margins, measuring 3 x 8 cm. A serpiginous tract was visible, and the mass had reportedly migrated recently across his upper chest wall. There was no additional rash and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a total white cell count of 8.9 ×10^9/L and a significant peripheral eosinophilia with an eosinophil count of 0.9 × 10^9/L (reference <0.5). Liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. HIV antibody testing was negative. Serology for Gnathostoma was negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was gnathostomiasis, given the classic presentation of a mobile subcutaneous mass, creeping eruption, and eosinophilia. Other parasitic causes were considered, including Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), which was deemed unlikely as it is not endemic to the exposure area and has a longer incubation period. Sparganosis, another cause of migratory swelling, was considered very rare. Cutaneous larva migrans from hookworms and Strongyloides were also considered less likely as they typically cause fine tracks, not a large mobile mass.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous gnathostomiasis was made, and treatment was initiated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 21 days and a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg. During the first six days of treatment, the lesion migrated over his shoulder and neck, disappeared for 24 hours, then reappeared between his eyebrows, moved to his forehead and face, and was felt inside his nose. On the sixth day, the patient expressed a larva from his nostril, which was identified as Gnathostoma spinigerum. His two symptomatic friends were also treated and had full resolution of their symptoms.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous gnathostomiasis caused by the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum. This was confirmed by the direct identification of the larva after it was expressed from the patient's nostril. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical syndrome of a migratory subcutaneous mass (larva migrans profundus), significant eosinophilia, and a history of consuming raw freshwater fish in an endemic area (Botswana). The initial negative serology does not rule out the disease, which was proven parasitologically.\n**Disease Name Short**: Gnathostomiasis\n\n## Case 20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.815)\n**Patient Information**: A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation.

He is described as being in fair general condition with no other significant medical history, comorbidities, or immunosuppression reported.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 3-year history of left-sided scrotal swelling.\n**History Of Present Illness**: A 23-year-old farmer presented with a left-sided scrotal swelling that had been gradually increasing in size over three years. The swelling was described as non-tender, and there was no history of fever. He had previously attempted treatment with traditional herbal medicine without any improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from the central part of Myanmar. He reported that scrotal swelling is a common problem in his home region, suggesting a possible endemic infectious cause. The text notes that lymphatic filariasis is endemic in Southeast Asia, but urogenital schistosomiasis is not.\n**Vitals**: His vital signs are reported as normal and he is afebrile.\n**Physical Exam**: On examination, there was a massive unilateral scrotal swelling which was non-tender and could not be manually reduced. There were no palpable inguinal lymph nodes.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: An ultrasound of the scrotum was performed and confirmed a hydrocoele. The text discusses other potential investigations for lymphatic filariasis, such as looking for the 'filarial dance sign' on ultrasound or using circulating filarial antigen (CFA) tests, but it does not state these were performed on this patient.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for a chronic, non-tender scrotal swelling included inguinal hernia, hydrocoele, and testicular tumour. Given the patient's report of similar cases in his region, an infectious etiology was strongly considered, with lymphatic filariasis (LF) being the most likely cause as hydrocoele is its most common manifestation. Urogenital schistosomiasis was considered less likely due to geographic location, and testicular tuberculosis was deemed improbable given the long duration without other systemic signs or symptoms.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was managed with a hydrocoelectomy, during which 3 litres of clear fluid were drained. He also received antifilarial treatment. He lived in a remote area and was lost to follow-up after the procedures.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is lymphatic filariasis presenting as a chronic hydrocoele. This is based on the clinical finding of a massive, non-tender, non-reducible scrotal swelling, which was confirmed to be a hydrocoele on ultrasound. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's epidemiology as a farmer from an endemic region in Myanmar where such conditions are common, and the administration of specific antifilarial treatment alongside surgery.\n**Disease Name Short**: Lymphatic Filariasis\n\n## Case 17---A-34-Year-Old-Man-from-Thailand-With-Feve_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.796)\n**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old man from Phuket, Thailand, presented to a hospital in Germany. He reported a significant weight loss of 7 kg in the last 3 months and on examination was very wasted, with a body mass index of 14 kg/m².\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-week history of fever and a papular rash.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For two weeks, the patient experienced fever and a papular rash affecting his whole body, particularly his face and trunk. This was in the context of a 3-month history of significant weight loss, totaling 7 kg.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in Thailand and had arrived in Germany only 3 days prior to presentation to visit friends. Talaromycosis is noted to be endemic to East and South-east Asia.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.76°F).\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a very wasted man with pale conjunctivae. He had a generalized, non-pruritic rash of small umbilicated papules, predominantly on his face and trunk. There was generalized lymphadenopathy, with swollen nodes in the left supraclavicular, inguinal, and axillary regions. Abdominal examination showed hepatosplenomegaly, with the spleen palpable two fingers below the left costal margin and a liver span of 15 cm in the midclavicular line.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed pancytopenia with a WBC of 2.1 ×10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelets of 110 ×10⁹/L. The C-reactive protein was elevated at 150 mg/L. An HIV test was positive, and the patient was found to be highly immunosuppressed with a CD4 cell count of 2/µL. Histopathology from a lymph node biopsy showed multiple yeast-like structures and no acid-fast bacilli. Blood cultures, as well as cultures from a skin biopsy and lymph node aspirate, all grew Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly included infectious diseases and neoplasms. Specific considerations were other viral infections like CMV and EBV, disseminated tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, melioidosis, and Bartonella spp. (bacillary angiomatosis). Other fungal infections such as cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis were also considered, along with visceral leishmaniasis and neoplasms like lymphoma.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The diagnosis of talaromycosis was made, and the patient was started on a 2-week course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, followed by oral itraconazole. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated. On 3-week follow-up, he was afebrile and gaining weight. Six months later, he presented with recurrent cervical lymphadenopathy. A relapse of talaromycosis was suspected, but an infection with atypical mycobacteria was found. This was interpreted as an unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), as his CD4 count had risen to 102/µL with a suppressed viral load.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was disseminated Talaromycosis, caused by the fungus Talaromyces marneffei. This occurred in the setting of severe immunosuppression from a previously undiagnosed HIV infection, confirmed by a positive HIV test and a CD4 count of 2/μL. The diagnosis was established by the isolation of T. marneffei from cultures of blood, skin, and lymph node tissue, supported by histopathology showing yeast-like structures.\n**Disease Name Short**: Talaromycosis""]","Diagnosis: Lymphatic Filariasis
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with lymphatic filariasis, which is a common tropical disease caused by the filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti. The patient's history of recurrent painful, swollen lymph nodes and the presence of a marked eosinophilia are characteristic of this condition.","The diagnosis is lymphatic filariasis, caused by the nematode Wuchereria bancrofti. This is strongly suggested by the patient's presentation of unilateral limb swelling (lymphedema) and recurrent adenolymphangitis, combined with his origin from an endemic area in Southern India. The diagnosis is supported by key laboratory findings of marked peripheral eosinophilia and a positive filarial serology test. Confirmation can also be achieved by detecting microfilariae on a blood film or through filarial antigen testing.",0.7394579478512583,0.75,0.9999999999
"A 28-year-old Kurdish refugee presented with a four-month history of upper abdominal pain and recent right-sided chest pain. He was afebrile and his weight was stable. An initial chest X-ray showed a mass in the right lung. A subsequent CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated a cystic structure in his liver, with additional cysts in his chest. The right lung lesion was surgically excised for diagnosis.

She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.\n**Vitals**: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Ebola virus disease\n\n## Case 73---A-21-Year-Old-Male-Migrant-from-Rural-Mali-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.792)\n**Patient Information**: A 21-year-old male migrant from rural Mali. He comes from a poor family, was initially unable to read or write, and had no other reported comorbidities. He was referred from a haematology department where a work-up for his condition was inconclusive.\n**Chief Complaint**: Referral for splenomegaly and bicytopenia; the patient reports intermittent fever and a feeling of ""heaviness"" on the left side of his abdomen.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports intermittent fever and abdominal heaviness on the left side for some time, though the exact duration is difficult to specify. He is otherwise clinically well, with no night sweats and a stable weight. An initial work-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at an outside department did not establish a diagnosis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a migrant from rural Mali who arrived in Germany one year prior to presentation. His journey included crossing Niger, spending several weeks in a detention center in Libya, and traveling through Italy to Germany. His origin in rural Mali constitutes significant exposure to stable malaria transmission.\n**Vitals**: At presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.98°F), blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a pulse of 64 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared clinically well. The main finding was a massively enlarged spleen palpated 15 cm below the left costal margin. There was no clinical anaemia or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac sounds were clear with no murmurs. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed splenomegaly with a spleen measuring 21.8 cm in longitudinal diameter with a homogenous parenchyma. The liver was normal in size, and flow in the portal and splenic veins was normal. There was no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial labs revealed a mild bicytopenia (WBC 3.3 x10⁹/L, Platelets 124 x10⁹/L). A key finding was a markedly elevated IgM of 8.59 g/L (reference range 0.4-2.3). Inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR were normal. Thick and thin blood films for Plasmodium were negative. However, P. falciparum indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was positive with a titer of 1:256. Further investigation with a PCR for P. falciparum DNA came back positive. Serologies for HIV, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis were all negative, as were blood cultures.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), supported by massive splenomegaly, very high IgM, positive malaria serology, and origin from an endemic area. Other possibilities were considered and deemed less likely: lymphoma/leukemia (due to normal differential count and LDH), visceral leishmaniasis (patient not severely ill), and schistosomiasis (normal liver on ultrasound).\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received one single course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. His reported episodes of fever subsequently subsided. Malaria PCR was still positive two weeks later but remained negative thereafter. He was monitored for 2.5 years, during which his IgM levels normalized (over 2 years) and his spleen size slowly decreased to 14 cm. The patient remained well and was permitted to stay in Germany after a medical letter was issued regarding the risk of splenic rupture if deported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS). This was confirmed in a patient from a malaria-endemic area (rural Mali) presenting with massive splenomegaly, bicytopenia, and exceptionally high polyclonal IgM. Although peripheral blood smears were negative, the diagnosis was supported by positive P. falciparum serology (IFAT 1:256) and definitively established by a positive P. falciparum PCR. The diagnosis was further solidified by the excellent clinical response (resolution of fever) and immunological/radiological improvement (slow decrease in IgM and spleen size) following a single course of antimalarial therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly\n\n## Case 50---A-24-Year-Old-Man-of-Turkish-Origin-With-Jau_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro (score=0.789)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old man of Turkish origin residing in Germany. He was diagnosed with cystic echinococcosis (CE) three years prior to the current presentation based on imaging and positive serology for Echinococcus granulosus.\n**Chief Complaint**: Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents with acute right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Three years earlier, he had a similar episode of pain, which led to the discovery of two calcified cystic liver lesions via ultrasound and CT scan. Serology at that time was positive for Echinococcus granulosus, confirming cystic echinococcosis. As the cysts were calcified and the patient was asymptomatic, he refused the offered surgical treatment and was instead monitored regularly with ultrasound.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient visits his family in rural eastern Turkey (Anatolia) annually for about six weeks. Provenance from a hyperendemic region is the single most important risk factor for cystic echinococcosis, which is caused by the ingestion of eggs from the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 64 bpm, and temperature was 36°C (96.8°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was in fair general condition with scleral jaundice. Abdominal examination revealed right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness without guarding.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The full blood count was normal. Liver function tests showed a cholestatic pattern with elevated AST (145 U/L), ALT (454 U/L), GGT (394 U/L), ALP (402 U/L), and total bilirubin (120 µmol/L). Inflammatory markers were elevated with a CRP of 49 mg/L. Imaging from 3 years prior showed two calcified cystic lesions in the liver (a 7x6 cm WHO CE3b cyst and a 5x4 cm WHO CE1 cyst). On the current admission, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) demonstrated biliary obstruction from a cystobiliary fistula, with cyst content found within the common bile duct.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: Differential diagnoses for cystic liver lesions in this patient included a congenital simple hepatic cyst, pseudocysts from alveolar echinococcosis, infectious causes like bacterial or amoebic abscesses, tuberculoma, and benign or malignant tumors. However, the patient\'s known history and positive serology made a complication of cystic echinococcosis the most likely diagnosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient\'s biliary obstruction was managed with a therapeutic ERC, during which cyst content was removed from the common bile duct. His associated cholangitis was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. After the acute inflammation settled, he underwent partial cystectomy for both cysts. The patient has been followed for nine years after surgery with no evidence of recurrence and is considered cured.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is complicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis, caused by the larval form of *Echinococcus granulosus*. The patient presented with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis secondary to a cystobiliary fistula, a known complication of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by finding cyst material in the common bile duct during an ERC procedure, in the context of a known history of CE with positive serology and characteristic imaging findings.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cystic echinococcosis\n\n## Case 79---A-34-Year-Old-Male-Immigrant-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.785)\n**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old man, originally from northern Peru, who has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He has a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively. His Peruvian wife and children are reported as healthy at presentation.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea with colicky abdominal pain and a weight loss of approximately 20 kg.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. For over 12 years, he has suffered from recurrent, less severe episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but the frequency of these episodes has increased over the past 2 years.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is an immigrant from northern Peru, a tropical region described as highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. He has resided in Chile for the last 9 years. His family history is notable for two close relatives (mother and brother) dying from wasting syndromes of unknown origin. Later investigation revealed his wife had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and was also HTLV-1 positive; one of his two children also had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection but was HTLV-1 negative.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient is cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass, a body weight of 44 kg, and a BMI of 17. Abdominal examination revealed slight pain on palpation. Otherwise, the physical examination was normal, with no fever, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable lymphadenopathy, and no peripheral oedema.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis (WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L), thrombocytosis (platelets 644 x 10^9/L), mild anemia (haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (protein 4.9 g/dL), and an elevated ESR (26 mm/h). An HIV test was negative. Abdominal CT and MRI scans were without pathological findings, and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was macroscopically normal. However, histology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Subsequent Baermann testing of a fresh stool sample demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis, and larvae were also found in respiratory secretions. Serology confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea and wasting in this patient centered on helminth infections. The two main considerations were Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium or Cystoisospora belli were also a possibility, though less likely in an HIV-negative patient. Given the patient\'s origin from a region highly endemic for S. stercoralis, this was considered the most probable cause.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. Following the diagnosis, he was treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day for 7 days), which was repeated after a 2-week interval. He recovered from his diarrhea and abdominal symptoms within weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, he had gained 13 kg, was free of postprandial cramps for the first time in over 10 years, and parasitological examination was negative. His wife and one child were also found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and were presumably treated.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann technique) and respiratory secretions. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a known risk factor, HTLV-1 co-infection (confirmed by serology), and the patient\'s geographic origin from an endemic area. The clinical picture of severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, along with the dramatic response to ivermectin, solidified the diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome']","Diagnosis: Cystic echinococcosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain and chest pain, are consistent with the clinical presentation of cystic echinococcosis. The presence of a mass in the right lung and additional cysts in the liver are also characteristic of this condition. The patient's age and the absence of fever further support the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis.","The diagnosis is hydatid disease, or cystic echinococcosis, caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The clinical suspicion is raised by the patient's origin from an endemic region and the presence of slowly growing cysts in the liver and lungs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the histopathological identification of a hydatid cyst from the excised lung lesion, which is the pathognomonic finding. Positive serology for Echinococcus provided further supportive evidence.",0.6026839321181852,0.5555555555555556,0.9999999999
"A 63-year-old man living in a hostel for the homeless presents with a one-month history of weakness, weight loss, night fevers, and breathlessness. He recently began coughing up blood, which prompted him to seek care at a walk-in clinic. On examination, he had a low-grade fever and bronchial breathing was noted on chest auscultation. A chest X-ray was performed, which demonstrated apical shadowing and a large cavitation. A sputum sample was collected for analysis.

He has not yet started antiretroviral medication. He has no history of previous tuberculosis. His wife is also HIV-positive.\n**Chief Complaint**: Progressing dark skin spots for one month, new facial swelling, and a three-month history of cough and worsening shortness of breath.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past month, the patient noticed dark spots on his arm and leg that were progressing, and he subsequently developed facial swelling. He also reports a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum accompanied by worsening shortness of breath. He denied any constitutional symptoms, including weight loss, fevers, or night sweats.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a businessman from Malawi. His wife is also HIV-positive, and his two young children have not yet been tested. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 36°C (96.8°F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was comfortable at rest with moderate facial oedema. Examination revealed widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Respiratory assessment showed decreased air entry and dullness at the right lung base. His right leg was swollen from the foot to the knee, with prominent, coalescing dark plaques. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The patient was confirmed to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. His hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and MCV was 88.4 fL. Sputum microscopy and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests were negative for tuberculosis. A chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifications with peribronchovascular changes in the lower and mid lung zones, noted as being typical for pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses were Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and pulmonary tuberculosis. The skin and palatal lesions were described as typical for KS, strongly suggesting the diagnosis and raising suspicion for pulmonary involvement. Tuberculosis was considered essential to rule out in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient with a chronic cough, especially as dual pathology with KS is not uncommon.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's primary concern was shortness of breath. Investigations for tuberculosis were negative. A bronchoscopy was attempted but failed due to technical difficulties. He received a short course of oral antibiotics with no improvement. He was subsequently referred to start antiretroviral medication and palliative chemotherapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Kaposi's sarcoma with extensive cutaneous, palatal, and pulmonary involvement, occurring in the context of advanced, untreated HIV infection (AIDS). The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical findings of widespread purplish plaques, a low CD4 count (134 cells/µL), and chest X-ray findings typical for pulmonary KS. Tuberculosis was actively considered and reasonably excluded based on negative sputum and GeneXpert tests.\n**Disease Name Short**: Kaposi's sarcoma\n\n## Case 33---A-53-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-C_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical- (score=0.820)\n**Patient Information**: A 53-year-old Malawian man, who is a non-smoker with an unremarkable past medical history. He was newly diagnosed with HIV infection and found to have advanced immunosuppression, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL.\n**Chief Complaint**: Productive cough for 3 months with associated night sweats and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of productive cough with whitish sputum, night sweats, and unquantified weight loss. Two months prior, he sought care for the same complaints and was treated with presumptive antimalarials and a 5-day course of amoxicillin, with no improvement in his symptoms. He is not on any regular medication.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a subsistence farmer in Malawi. He reports no known tuberculosis (TB) contacts and has no history of working in mines or the construction industry. He is married with five children, who are all well.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 88 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 97% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared slightly wasted and mildly anaemic. Examination of the mouth revealed no oral thrush, Kaposi's sarcoma, or oral hairy leukoplakia. His chest was clear to auscultation, and heart sounds were normal without murmurs. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the liver and spleen were not enlarged.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The HIV test was reactive, with a CD4 count of 54 cells/µL. Laboratory results showed leukopenia (WBC 3.2 x 10^9/L) and anemia (Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), with normal platelets. Two sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, as were a Malaria RDT and a thick smear for Plasmodium spp. A chest radiograph on admission showed a prominent hilar region bilaterally but was otherwise normal. Induced sputum was also negative for AFB, and sputum PCR was not available.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The most likely diagnosis was smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's HIV-positive status with advanced immunosuppression, chronic constitutional symptoms, and lack of response to antibiotics. Other considerations included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a bacterial chest infection, and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, although the latter was less likely without cutaneous or mucosal lesions. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) was also considered.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and prophylactic co-trimoxazole, but his fever persisted. On hospital day 7, he was started on empirical treatment for smear-negative TB with a four-drug regimen (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol). After one week of antituberculous therapy, he began to feel better, his fever resolved, and the cough gradually settled. Three weeks into his TB treatment, he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with advanced HIV infection. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic presentation of chronic cough, weight loss, and fever in a severely immunosuppressed individual (CD4 count 54), which is a common presentation for TB in this setting. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's prompt clinical response to empirical antituberculous treatment after failing to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Negative sputum smears and non-specific radiographic findings (hilar prominence) are typical for HIV-associated TB.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculosis (HIV-associated)\n\n## Case 55---A-40-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.810)\n**Patient Information**: A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously, and a recent HIV ELISA test was negative. The patient denies recent travels.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, and significant weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized for similar complaints, at which time three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical and radiographic findings, and he was started on first-line TB therapy. Despite adherence, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistent cough that developed streaking of blood, leading to a referral for suspected multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB).\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from a rural area in the Peruvian Amazon. His occupation and geographic origin are relevant for endemic fungal infections. He denies recent travels.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg, pulse was 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared fatigued and cachectic. Examination revealed a few small, mobile, soft, non-tender cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes. Auscultation of the lungs found bilateral crackles and rhonchi. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed significant thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 1093 × 10^9/L; the rest of the full blood count was normal. Two repeated AFB smears and a tuberculin skin test were negative. A chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates, predominantly in the central and upper zones, with multiple cavities in the right lung and no hilar lymphadenopathy. Examination of a sputum potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed the characteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and the organism was subsequently grown in culture.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses considered were MDR TB, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. TB is highly endemic in Peru, making it a necessary consideration. Histoplasmosis can mimic TB symptoms. However, paracoccidioidomycosis was deemed most likely given the patient's age, gender, occupation (farmer), geographic origin (Peruvian Amazon), and clinical presentation, which are all typical for the chronic form of this mycosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial treatment with first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was ineffective. After the definitive diagnosis was made, TB treatment was discontinued. Due to the extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole. The thrombocytosis was considered a reactive process to the chronic infection.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. It was confirmed by the visualization of characteristic yeast forms on a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, with subsequent isolation in fungal culture. The clinical picture, including the failure to respond to empiric TB therapy and the patient's specific demographic and exposure profile as a farmer from the Peruvian Amazon, strongly supported this diagnosis over tuberculosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Paracoccidioidomycosis\n\n## Case 47---A-32-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-Pain_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.810)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old Malawian man with a known history of HIV, who was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis two months prior to presentation. His recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL. His past medical history is significant for treatment for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and a painfully swollen neck.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a six-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, accompanied by a painful neck swelling. Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi and had not left the country. Multi-drug resistance for TB is noted to be uncommon in this region. No other specific occupational or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, he was moderately ill, pale, and sweating with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), a pulse of 112 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing man with large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. Over the course of his hospital stay, these glands became more swollen and clearly fluctuant. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with IRIS""]","Diagnosis: Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)
Reason: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with pulmonary TB, including the presence of apical shadowing and a large cavitation on the chest X-ray. The patient's history of coughing up blood and recent onset of symptoms suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary TB.","The diagnosis is pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's social history of homelessness is a major risk factor for reactivation TB. His clinical presentation of constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) and respiratory symptoms (hemoptysis, breathlessness) is highly suggestive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic chest X-ray findings of apical shadowing and cavitation.

"A 32-year-old woman originally from Brazil presented with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness affecting her face, arm, and leg. She also reported recent shortness of breath on exertion. A CT scan of her brain confirmed an acute stroke. Her ECG was abnormal, showing broadened QRS complexes, and a chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with a characteristic apical aneurysm. A small thrombus was noted within the aneurysm, consistent with a cardioembolic source for her stroke.","[""## Case 51---A-34-Year-Old-HIV-Positive-Woman-from-Malawi-W_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.794)\n**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old Malawian woman diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV 5 months prior to presentation. At that time, her baseline CD4 count was 54/µL. She is currently taking antituberculous therapy, vitamin B6, antiretroviral therapy, and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.\n**Chief Complaint**: Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a 3-month period.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's problems began approximately 3 months earlier with a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed insidiously, and over the following weeks, her left arm also became affected. She is noted to be a poor historian. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment, or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in an urban high-density area in Malawi and works as a street vendor. She is divorced and has no children. No specific exposures to animals, water, or sick contacts are mentioned.\n**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: General examination is normal except for slightly pale conjunctivae. Fundoscopy is normal with no signs of papilloedema or retinitis. Neurological examination reveals a spastic hemiparesis on the left with hyperreflexia. Power is 2/5 in the left leg and 3/5 in the left arm, with a pronator drift on the left. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A full blood count showed a WBC of 3.8 x 10⁹/L, haemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelets of 140 x 10⁹/L. Routine CSF examination was normal, and India Ink stain with fungal cultures were negative. A cerebral MRI performed after 8 weeks of symptoms showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter, more prominent in the right hemisphere, and a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for focal brain lesions in this HIV-positive patient included cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CNS tuberculosis. The onset of symptoms two months after starting ART raised the possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), potentially unmasking a pre-existing infection. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were considered unlikely due to the slow, progressive nature of the illness.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's existing antiretroviral, antituberculous, and co-trimoxazole therapies were continued. She was started on empirical high-dose co-trimoxazole for presumed toxoplasmosis and prednisolone 1 mg/kg for possible IRIS. At 4-week follow-up, her condition was unchanged, and by 8 weeks, her left-sided weakness had deteriorated further. Following the MRI results, a presumed diagnosis of PML was made, and she was referred to a rehabilitation centre and a palliative care team.\n**Final Diagnosis**: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely occurring as an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PML-IRIS). The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 54/µL) that began two months after initiating antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis was strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions and the lack of clinical response to empirical treatment for other opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n## Case 28---A-67-Year-Old-Female-Expatriate-Living-in-Came_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.788)\n**Patient Information**: A 67-year-old German woman who has lived as an expatriate in Cameroon for the past 4 years. Her past medical history is noted to be otherwise unremarkable.\n**Chief Complaint**: Presentation with palpitations and a report of transient subcutaneous swellings over the past year.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports palpitations and transient subcutaneous swellings over the past year, with no history of fever or constitutional symptoms. A 24-hour ECG recording performed elsewhere showed paroxysmal supraventricular extrasystoles. An initial echocardiogram revealed a minimal pericardial effusion.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient has resided as an expatriate in Cameroon, a region in West/Central Africa endemic for loiasis, for the past 4 years.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal and the patient was afebrile.\n**Physical Exam**: On physical examination, the patient's heart sounds were clear and regular with no murmurs. There were no visible subcutaneous swellings or other pathological findings noted.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial full blood count showed eosinophilia with an eosinophil percentage of 14% and an absolute eosinophil count of 0.868 x10^9/L. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. Serology for filarial infections was positive. Examination of a Giemsa-stained day-blood sample revealed sheathed microfilariae with a tapered tail, characteristic of Loa loa, with a microfilarial count of 1400/mL.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnoses considered for the combination of skin swellings and eosinophilia included non-specific urticaria, loiasis (Calabar swellings), cysticercosis, larva currens from Strongyloides infection, and Mansonella perstans infection. Acute schistosomiasis was deemed less likely due to the patient's afebrile state and the nature of the swellings. Gnathostomiasis and sparganosis were also considered but are less common in Africa.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated cautiously, first with albendazole and then with ivermectin. The therapy was well tolerated. Post-treatment, the absolute eosinophil count returned to normal, the microfilarial count declined, and the palpitations resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram 3 months later was normal, showing resolution of the pericardial effusion, and a repeat 24-hour ECG was also normal.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is Loiasis caused by the filarial nematode *Loa loa*. This was confirmed by the identification of sheathed microfilariae with tapered tails characteristic of the species in a day-blood sample, with a count of 1400/mL. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical triad of transient subcutaneous swellings, peripheral eosinophilia, and a compatible exposure history from living in Cameroon for 4 years. The patient's cardiac manifestations, including palpitations and a minimal pericardial effusion, resolved following anti-filarial treatment.\n**Disease Name Short**: Loiasis\n\n## Case 89---A-30-Year-Old-Woman-from-Bolivia-With-Ex_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.777)\n**Patient Information**: A 30-year-old woman, born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with no relevant past medical history and taking no medications. She presented to a clinic in Spain 4 months after arriving in Europe and expressed a wish to become pregnant.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-year history of progressive dyspnoea on moderate exertion and self-limiting palpitations.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported a two-year history of progressive dyspnoea at moderate exertion (New York Heart Association grade II) accompanied by self-limiting palpitations. The presentation was notable for the absence of clinical signs of heart failure.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient was born in Bolivia and grew up in a rural area during her childhood, a known risk factor for Chagas disease. She had been living in an urban environment for the past 20 years and had arrived in Europe 4 months prior to her presentation. Her origin from a highly endemic country prompted screening for Chagas disease.\n**Vitals**: On examination, her blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg, her pulse was regular at 40 beats per minute, and her SpO2 was 99% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination was unremarkable. Cardiac auscultation revealed clear sounds with no murmurs, the chest was clear, and there was no peripheral oedema or raised jugular venous pressure.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count and basic blood chemistry were normal. Serological testing for Chagas disease was positive on two different assays detecting IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi. An ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a right bundle branch block. A chest radiograph demonstrated a moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiomegaly). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophic left ventricle without obstruction.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: For a recent migrant from Bolivia, the initial differential screening panel included active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and strongyloidiasis. However, Chagas disease was the primary consideration due to the patient's specific origin, the high prevalence in that region, and the clinical findings of bradycardia and conduction abnormalities, which are characteristic of chagasic cardiomyopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was diagnosed with chagasic cardiomyopathy and started on antitrypanosomal therapy with benznidazole (5 mg/kg per day) for 60 days, given her intent to become pregnant. Fifteen days into the course, she developed a pruritic maculopapular rash and mild eosinophilia, which resolved after temporary discontinuation of benznidazole and a 5-day course of corticosteroids and antihistamines. Benznidazole was successfully re-introduced, and she completed the full 60-day treatment. At a 5-year follow-up, her cardiac function was stable, and she had given birth to a healthy child.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is chronic Chagas disease with chagasic cardiomyopathy, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Confirmation was based on positive results from two different serological tests for IgG antibodies. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's epidemiological history of growing up in a rural endemic area (Bolivia) and clinical evidence of cardiac involvement, including sinus bradycardia, right bundle branch block on ECG, cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, and a hypertrophic left ventricle on echocardiogram.\n**Disease Name Short**: Chagas disease\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.773)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease""]","Diagnosis: Acute cardioembolic stroke
Reason: The patient's symptoms of acute stroke, including left-sided weakness, shortness of breath on exertion, and an abnormal ECG with broadened QRS complexes, are consistent with a cardioembolic stroke. The presence of a dilated left ventricle with an apical aneurysm and a small thrombus within the aneurysm also supports this diagnosis. The patient's age of 32 years is also consistent with the typical age of stroke onset.","The final diagnosis is chronic Chagas disease with associated cardiomyopathy and a resulting embolic stroke. This is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's origin from Brazil, an endemic country, and her clinical presentation with heart failure and a stroke. The characteristic cardiac findings of a dilated left ventricle with an apical aneurysm and intracardiac thrombus are classic for Chagas cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive ELISA test for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies.",0.6096099017561065,0.0,0.9999999999
"A university professor presents with malaise and headache after returning from a botanical expedition in Kenya. He developed a large, swollen, and painful black lesion on his thigh. An initial course of antibiotics for a suspected skin infection was ineffective, and his headache and myalgia persisted. Upon evaluation at a travel clinic, the lesion was identified as a tick bite. Physical examination also revealed regional lymphadenopathy. Blood was drawn for serology to confirm a suspected tick-borne illness before appropriate antibiotic therapy was started.

He denied any joint pains or rash. The symptoms developed ten days after returning from a trip to South Africa.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday trip to South Africa, which concluded 10 days prior to presentation. His travel included visiting Cape Town, the Garden Route, KwaZulu-Natal, and going on safari in Kruger Park and other game reserves. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.\n**Vitals**: On examination, after having taken 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5°C (99.5°F). His pulse was 80 bpm and his blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was in fair general condition, with no jaundice and a supple neck. There were enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin. A small necrotic skin lesion (eschar), about 0.7 cm in diameter, was noted on his left upper thigh, with surrounding inflammation, lymphangiitis, and adjoining lymphadenitis.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin blood films for malaria, were both negative. The text notes that PCR from an eschar scab can confirm the diagnosis, but does not state if this was performed.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was African tick-bite fever, based on the typical eschar and recent travel history to an endemic safari region. Malaria was a critical differential diagnosis that needed to be ruled out, as the patient was a febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region (KwaZulu-Natal) without having taken chemoprophylaxis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was prescribed doxycycline 100 mg twice daily by mouth for one week. Following treatment, the fever settled within a few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after approximately two weeks.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was African tick-bite fever, a rickettsial disease caused by Rickettsia africae. The diagnosis was made clinically, based on the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and a history of safari travel in an endemic region of Southern Africa. Malaria, a key differential diagnosis, was excluded by negative rapid diagnostic tests and blood smears.\n**Disease Name Short**: African tick-bite fever\n\n## Case 78---A-42-Year-Old-British-Man-Living-in-Malawi_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropi (score=0.799)\n**Patient Information**: A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months. He has a family history of allergy. He had previously kept bees and been stung frequently without ill effect, but 9 months prior to admission, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed an asthmatic attack that resolved spontaneously.\n**Chief Complaint**: Florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, and a feeling of impending death.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported a suspected tick bite on his ankle two days before presenting. Twenty-four hours later, he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He was seen at a clinic where a malaria blood film was negative and was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash and subsequently became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, an expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months, was walking in the countryside two days before his illness began. A more specific exposure was later identified: a visit to a national game park two weeks before his illness, where he suffered numerous painful bites from tsetse flies.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his vital signs were: temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg. On day 3, he developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39°C.\n**Physical Exam**: On initial examination, the patient was clammy, in a state of collapse, with a widespread urticarial rash, respiratory distress, and stridor. Chest auscultation revealed expiratory wheezes. A painless, indurated, circumscribed swelling was noted on the inside of his left ankle. On day 3 of admission, the urticaria, stridor, and wheezing resolved, replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash, a slightly puffy face, and a bad headache.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 17.4 d/dL, a white cell count of 6.1 G/L (85% polymorphs), and an ESR of 5 mm/hour. A blood film for malaria parasites, chest radiograph, and stool and urine microscopy were all negative. On day 3, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. A lumbar puncture performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was anaphylactic shock, presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (like acute schistosomiasis), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease, though the absence of eosinophilia was noted. After the clinical picture changed on day 3, with fever, headache, and a new rash, trypanosomiasis was suspected.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated for anaphylactic shock with intramuscular adrenaline, with good effect. He was admitted and received intermittent IM adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistamines for two days. After the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was confirmed on day 3, he was treated with a full course of suramin, totaling 5.75g, starting with a test dose. His urine was monitored weekly during treatment and showed transient protein, casts, and white cells, which resolved after treatment finished.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis, likely caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. Although the initial presentation was an atypical anaphylactic shock, the subsequent development of fever, headache, an erythematous rash, and the recognition of a trypanosomal chancre at the bite site led to the correct diagnosis. The key epidemiological link was the exposure to tsetse fly bites in a game park two weeks prior. The infection was determined to be first-stage as the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\n**Disease Name Short**: East African Trypanosomiasis\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.789)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis\n\n## Case 21---A-35-Year-Old-American-Man-With-Fatigue-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.783)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Caucasian male with an unremarkable past medical history. He works as a postal worker and has had no foreign travel within the previous year or contact with animals.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fatigue and a neck lesion that started as a papule two days prior.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a rash on his neck that began as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before its onset while shaving. He had been seen in a clinic 24 hours prior and was discharged on an oral cephalosporin, but returned due to worsening malaise, neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a postal worker in the United States with no recent foreign travel, contact with animals, or known insect bites. The case occurred during an investigation into a bioterrorism event, and his exposure was later determined to be from handling contaminated mail during his occupation.\n**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His neck circumference had increased from a baseline of 57 cm to a peak of 81 cm.\n**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed a 2 cm irregularly shaped, indurated, non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema which made lymph node assessment difficult. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, were normal except for a mildly elevated hemoglobin at 18.7 g/dL. Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. A subsequent Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion were negative for B. anthracis. However, a skin biopsy sent to a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed the presence of B. anthracis antigens. Convalescent serology revealed the presence of antibodies to protective antigen.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for an ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. Given the ongoing bioterrorism investigation in the United States at the time, cutaneous anthrax was the most important diagnosis to consider, supported by the presence of a painless papule evolving into an ulcer with extensive, non-tender edema and systemic symptoms without significant fever.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with a first-generation cephalosporin but his condition worsened. Upon his return to the clinic, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam. Following this treatment regimen, the patient recovered.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a skin biopsy which showed abundant B. anthracis antigens, and by serology showing antibodies to protective antigen in convalescent serum. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's clinical picture of a painless ulcer with massive edema and his occupational exposure as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a known bioterrorism event.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cutaneous anthrax""]","Diagnosis: African tick-bite fever
Reason: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with African tick-bite fever, a rickettsial disease caused by Rickettsia africae. The patient's travel history to an endemic region of Southern Africa, the presence of regional lymphadenopathy, and the identification of an inoculation eschar are all characteristic of this disease.","The diagnosis is African Tick Bite Fever, a form of rickettsiosis. This is strongly suggested by the patient's travel history to Kenya and the clinical presentation of a painful black eschar (tache noire) at the site of a tick bite. The associated symptoms of headache, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy are also characteristic of this infection, which is caused by the bacterium *Rickettsia africae*.

She presented to an outpatient clinic in Germany.\n**Chief Complaint**: Severe headache for the past 8 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported an 8-day history of severe, gradual-onset headache that did not respond to painkillers. She denied fever, chills, visual problems, limb weakness, or memory problems. Three days earlier, she had presented to a municipal hospital where a CT scan of her brain and a blood count were both normal. Her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared meals while traveling, also developed a severe headache.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Ten days prior to presentation, the patient returned from a 4-week journey to north-east Thailand, where she visited friends and relatives. During her visit, she ate traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. The occurrence of similar symptoms in her brother-in-law after sharing meals suggests a common source outbreak.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a supple neck and a negative Lasègue's sign. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, with no cranial nerve palsies. The remainder of the neurological examination was unremarkable, including higher cortical functions. There was no rash, oral thrush, subcutaneous swellings, lymphadenopathy, or enlargement of the liver and spleen. The cardiopulmonary examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (WBC 12.3 x 10⁹/L) with marked peripheral eosinophilia (2.34 x 10⁹/L) and an elevated IgE of 944 U/mL. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 34 cmH2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 1877 leukocytes/µL with 42% eosinophils, elevated protein at 1.59 g/L, and low glucose at 1.85 mmol/L. CSF microscopy, cultures, and antigen tests for bacteria and fungi were negative. After discharge, serology results came back positive, with a Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD antigen of Angiostrongylus cantonensis.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The presumptive diagnosis was a food-borne parasitic infection causing eosinophilic meningitis, supported by the travel history, dietary exposure, and peripheral eosinophilia. The main differential diagnoses for eosinophilic meningitis considered included fungal infections, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Other parasitic causes such as neurocysticercosis, fascioliasis, and paragonimiasis were ruled out by negative serologies.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent repeated lumbar punctures, which relieved her headache. She was prescribed iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia but received no specific antiparasitic treatment. After a one-week hospital stay, she was discharged significantly improved. At a 4-week follow-up, she had fully recovered, and her peripheral eosinophil count had returned to normal.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis due to infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis. This is supported by the clinical presentation of severe headache, the exposure history involving consumption of potential intermediate hosts like snails or frogs in an endemic region, and laboratory findings of marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot test showing specific antibodies against the 31kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen.\n**Disease Name Short**: Angiostrongyliasis\n\n## Case 13---A-16-Year-Old-Girl-from-Malawi-With-Fever_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.724)\n**Patient Information**: A 16-year-old Malawian girl who delivered a baby 5 months prior. An HIV test performed during her antenatal care was negative. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She is in a fair nutritional state.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache for the past 5 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient, a 16-year-old girl, presented to a local hospital with a 5-day history of fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache. No other details on the progression of the illness are provided.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives with her parents, three siblings, and her baby in an urban, high-density area in Malawi. The household has no running water or electricity, and the family fetches water from a community tap. She recently dropped out of primary school during her pregnancy. Malawi is noted to be highly endemic for schistosomiasis.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, pulse was 78 bpm, and respiratory rate was 20 breath cycles per minute. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared in a fair nutritional state with mild scleral jaundice. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse tenderness without guarding. The liver was not enlarged, but the spleen was palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Chest and pelvic examinations were unremarkable, with no vaginal discharge.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, MCV of 90 fL, and platelets of 164 x 10^9/L. Creatinine was 71 µmol/L. A blood film for malaria parasites was positive with a parasite density described as 'low'. Liver function tests were not available. A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures subsequently grew Salmonella Typhi.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and enteric fever. Malaria could explain many symptoms, though the abdominal pain was noted as unusual, and low parasitemia is common in semi-immune individuals in endemic areas. Enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid) was considered due to the combination of abdominal tenderness, splenomegaly, frontal headache, and relative bradycardia. Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis were also considered possibilities.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Upon admission, the patient was started on oral artemether/lumefantrine and intravenous ceftriaxone 2g daily. After blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi, the antibiotic was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily. The patient's fever began to resolve on day 5 of antibiotic treatment, and she was discharged on day 7 to complete a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin. She was also given a single dose of praziquantel due to the high endemicity of schistosomiasis in Malawi, which can favor chronic carriage of S. Typhi.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Typhoid Fever caused by Salmonella Typhi. This was definitively confirmed by a positive blood culture. The clinical presentation of prolonged fever, abdominal pain, headache, splenomegaly, and relative bradycardia was highly consistent with enteric fever. The patient also had a concurrent malaria infection with low parasitemia, which was treated, but her sustained illness and response to ciprofloxacin pointed to typhoid as the primary diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Typhoid fever\n\n## Case 57---A-37-Year-Old-Woman-from-Malawi-With-H_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical- (score=0.717)\n**Patient Information**: A 37-year-old woman from Malawi with an unremarkable past medical history. She does not take regular painkillers or drink alcohol. An HIV test conducted 3 months prior was negative.\n**Chief Complaint**: Three episodes of vomiting bright red blood over the past 24 hours.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a first episode of haematemesis, having vomited bright red blood three times in the last 24 hours. She reported no epigastric pain, no previous history of vomiting, no fever, and no other abnormal bleeding. Her stool was normal in colour. Prior to symptom onset, she was well.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives and works on a large sugar plantation in the Lower Shire Valley of southern Malawi, a region described as highly endemic for schistosomiasis where water bodies are infested with Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium.\n**Vitals**: On admission, she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, a pulse of 110 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, consistent with shock.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was slim, afebrile, and slightly pale but not jaundiced. Abdominal examination revealed a non-tender abdomen with no distension, a palpable spleen 10 cm below the left costal margin, and a slightly enlarged liver. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease, shifting dullness, peripheral oedema, or enlarged lymph nodes.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed pancytopenia with normocytic anaemia: WBC 2.8 x 10^9/L, haemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, MCV 88 fL, and platelets 130 x 10^9/L. Subsequent investigations included an endoscopy which confirmed the presence of oesophageal varices as the source of bleeding. Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. A single stool sample for S. mansoni ova was negative. An ultrasound of the liver described a pattern typical of 'pipestem fibrosis'.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices due to portal hypertension, strongly suggested by the combination of splenomegaly and pancytopenia in a patient from a schistosomiasis-endemic area. Other causes of GI bleeding like peptic ulcer disease or erosive gastritis were considered less likely as they would not explain the splenomegaly. Visceral leishmaniasis was also considered but deemed less probable due to the absence of fever and its rarity in Southern Africa.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was managed with IV fluids and transferred to a central hospital for an endoscopy, where variceal banding was performed. After confirming the likely diagnosis, she received a single dose of praziquantel 40 mg/kg and was subsequently discharged home.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is hepatosplenic schistosomiasis causing portal hypertension and bleeding oesophageal varices. This conclusion is based on the patient's classic presentation of haematemesis with marked splenomegaly and pancytopenia, her long-term exposure in a highly endemic region of Malawi, and the exclusion of other common causes like chronic viral hepatitis. The diagnosis was further solidified by ultrasound findings of 'pipestem fibrosis', a pathognomonic sign of hepatic schistosomiasis, and endoscopic confirmation of varices as the bleeding source.\n**Disease Name Short**: Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis\n\n## Case 94---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Democratic-Republic-_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.716)\n**Patient Information**: A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children. Notably, she was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programs were stopped in the early 1980s.\n**Chief Complaint**: A history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and neck swelling, followed by a disseminated skin rash.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever, malaise, headache, and a dry cough. Two days later, a disseminated skin rash appeared, beginning on her face and spreading centrifugally to her body, including the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. The skin lesions evolved from macules to papules, then vesicles, and finally to pustules. The oral lesions were painful, making it difficult to eat and drink.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural agricultural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area where monkeypox is endemic. She is part of a population with waning herd immunity to orthopoxviruses, as she was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A specific animal or human contact was not identified, which is common in such settings.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed disseminated, uniform, umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, with a predilection for the face, hands, and feet. There was generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen, and central nervous system was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results at presentation included a White Blood Cell count of 4.4 x 10^9/L (73% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and an elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. The diagnosis was made clinically, as definitive laboratory testing such as PCR or culture is often unavailable in endemic regions.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this vesiculopustular rash included poxvirus infections. Monkeypox was the main suspicion due to the endemic location, rash characteristics, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Varicella was also considered but is less likely given the uniform stage of the lesions and palm/sole involvement. Cowpox was deemed unlikely as it usually presents with a single lesion and uncommonly causes significant fever or lymphadenopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Management was exclusively supportive, as no specific treatment is available for monkeypox. The patient made an uneventful recovery but was left with scarring from the skin lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is human monkeypox, made on clinical grounds. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile prodrome followed by a characteristic centrifugal, vesiculopustular rash with lesions in a uniform stage of development, including on the palms and soles. The presence of prominent lymphadenopathy and the patient's residence in an endemic area of the DRC further support this diagnosis over differentials like varicella. Her age indicates she was not vaccinated against smallpox, increasing her susceptibility.\n**Disease Name Short**: Human monkeypox""]","Diagnosis: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including the mucopurulent discharge and the presence of a positive endocervical swab for HPV, are consistent with HPV infection. The patient is sexually active and taking oral contraceptives, which are risk factors for HPV infection. Additionally, the patient's age is within the typical age range for HPV infection.","The diagnosis is chlamydial cervicitis, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation as a sexually active young woman with mid-cycle bleeding, and the characteristic physical exam findings of a mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical friability. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive laboratory test for Chlamydia from an endocervical swab specimen.",0.22271450383941066,0.0,0.0
"A 37-year-old woman from Southern Mexico presented with a persistent body rash. Her symptoms began five years prior with spasms and needle-like pain in her arms, accompanied by fatigue. She was initially treated for depression and atopic dermatitis. Physical examination revealed numerous hypopigmented skin lesions on her arms, face, abdomen, back, and legs. She also had thinning eyebrows and numbness in her forearm. A skin biopsy was taken from an abdominal lesion for analysis.

There was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. The following day, the rash worsened and she developed non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. She presented to the outpatient department six days after her return.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting to medical care 6 days after her return. The incubation period is consistent with an arboviral infection acquired in Central America.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed non-purulent conjunctivitis and a generalized maculopapular rash that also involved the face. Additionally, there was tender edema of the hands, elbows, knees, and feet, along with generalized lymphadenopathy affecting the cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a normal full blood count and liver function tests. CRP was slightly elevated at 8 mg/L and creatinine was very mildly elevated at 87 µmol/L. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and chikungunya were negative. Subsequent testing at a reference laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection by a positive RT-PCR on an initial blood sample. Paired serology showed seroconversion, with a Zika IgM titer of 1:640 and a significant rise in Zika IgG from 1:20 to 1:5120. A rise in Dengue IgG was also noted but interpreted as cross-reactivity.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical presentation was considered highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The primary differential diagnoses included the three most important arboviruses in Central and South America: dengue, chikungunya, and zika. Although they can have similar presentations, the combination of a skin rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral edema in an afebrile patient was considered highly indicative of a Zika virus infection.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The case notes that arboviral infections are self-limiting and management is exclusively supportive, as there are no specific treatment options. The specific supportive care provided to this patient and her clinical outcome were not detailed.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Acute Zika virus infection was diagnosed. The confirmation was based on a positive Zika virus RT-PCR from a blood sample taken 6 days after symptom onset. The diagnosis was further supported by seroconversion in paired serum samples, which demonstrated a positive Zika IgM and a significant rise in Zika IgG titer. Dengue and chikungunya were ruled out by negative tests, and the rise in Dengue IgG was attributed to serological cross-reactivity common among flaviviruses.\n**Disease Name Short**: Zika virus infection\n\n## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.821)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 94---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Democratic-Republic-_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.814)\n**Patient Information**: A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis""]","Diagnosis: Acute disseminated histoplasmosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including the persistent body rash, hypopigmented skin lesions, and the presence of hypopigmented skin lesions on the face, abdomen, back, and legs, are characteristic of acute disseminated histoplasmosis. The patient's history of depression and atopic dermatitis, as well as the physical examination findings, also support the diagnosis of acute disseminated histoplasmosis.","The diagnosis is lepromatous leprosy (LL), a form of Hansen's disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This is supported by the patient's origin from an endemic region (Mexico) and the chronic clinical presentation of numerous hypopigmented skin lesions, thinning eyebrows (madarosis), and peripheral neuropathy (numbness). The diagnosis was confirmed by a skin biopsy from an abdominal lesion, which revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli.",0.6713911536384889,0.16666666666666666,0.0
"A 40-year-old male from Nepal presented with a four-day history of severe pain, swelling, and discoloration of his left hand. He reported being bitten by a snake on his left little finger four days prior and had not sought any medical care. On examination, he was febrile and tachycardic. There was a large, tense, fluctuant swelling on the dorsum of his left hand with overlying bluish skin discoloration, and the entire left little finger was black. Laboratory studies showed a high white blood cell count with a neutrophilic predominance. An ultrasound of the hand revealed a significant fluid collection consistent with an abscess.

No underlying comorbidities or immunosuppression were reported. Liver function tests and serum glucose remained normal during treatment.\n**Chief Complaint**: Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on the left foot and lower leg, with acute swelling and pain for three days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The condition began ten years prior, following a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week after the bite, a small painless red nodule developed at the site. Over the subsequent years, the lesion slowly enlarged, and further cauliflower-like and plaque-like lesions developed, spreading up to his knee. Three days before admission, his ankle became acutely painful and swollen, prompting him to seek care.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer residing in northern Laos. The initial lesion developed at the site of a leech bite ten years ago, suggesting traumatic inoculation in an agricultural setting. The causative agents for this condition are typically found in plant debris or forest detritus, and male agricultural workers are the most commonly affected demographic.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal, and the patient was afebrile upon admission.\n**Physical Exam**: The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and hot skin. There were multiple cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were described as partly erythematous, partly fungating, and purulent, with a bad odour.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Bacterial culture of pus from the lesions grew Escherichia coli. Direct microscopic investigation of wet film skin scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis, which were made more visible with 10% potassium hydroxide solution. PCR from skin tissue was positive, and sequencing showed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic verrucous skin lesions included fungal infections like sporotrichosis and mycetoma, as well as mycobacterial infections such as cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and Kaposi's Sarcoma were also considered. Non-infectious causes like squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis were possibilities. The acute signs of pain, swelling, and purulence suggested a secondary bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and treated with local iodine-based antiseptics and initial oral antibiotics (cloxacillin and metronidazole), which were later changed to co-trimoxazole based on culture sensitivities. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days, monthly pulse therapy) along with surgical debridement. Later, oral terbinafine (500-750 mg/d for 9 months) and local terbinafine ointment were added. The lesions healed uneventfully, leaving some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection. This was confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of brownish, round, multiseptate sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies') on direct microscopy of skin scrapings. The causative agent was identified by PCR and sequencing as Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, F. nubica). The clinical presentation of slowly progressive verrucous lesions on a lower limb following minor trauma in a farmer is classic for this disease. The patient also had a secondary bacterial superinfection with E. coli, which was successfully treated.\n**Disease Name Short**: Chromoblastomycosis\n\n## Case 32---A-44-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Laos-With-Di_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.812)\n**Patient Information**: A 44-year-old male rice farmer from Southern Laos. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 4 years prior but was non-compliant with oral antidiabetic drugs and follow-up.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 1-month history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia, arthralgia, and a painful swelling over the left scapula.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Over one month, the patient developed fever, headache, myalgia, and a painful, gradually enlarging swelling over his left scapula without any preceding trauma. One week before admission, the lesion was incised and drained, and he was started on cloxacillin without improvement. In the 2 days prior to admission, he deteriorated with high fever, chills, and severe malaise.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a rice farmer in Southern Laos, and his presentation occurred during the rainy season. This occupation and geographical setting, combined with his diabetes, constitute significant risk factors for melioidosis.\n**Vitals**: The patient appeared septic with a fever of 40°C (104°F), a heart rate of 136 bpm, a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was pale and jaundiced. There was a 2.5 x 4 cm erythematous swelling in the left scapular region with pus discharging from a central wound, but no regional lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crepitations and reduced breath sounds at both lung bases. The abdomen was soft with no palpable organomegaly.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of 16.2×10^9/L with 92.1% polymorphs, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, and platelets of 112×10^9/L. Chemistry was notable for severe hyperglycemia (glucose 20.6 mmol/L), elevated liver enzymes (AST 131 U/L, ALT 83 U/L), and marked hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 111.2 µmol/L, direct 56.4 µmol/L). Pus culture from the abscess and subsequent blood cultures both grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral pleural effusions. An abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly without liver or splenic abscesses.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included a typical bacterial abscess with sepsis (caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, or Klebsiella pneumoniae), tuberculosis, and melioidosis. Given the patient's epidemiological risk factors (farmer in Laos, rainy season) and immunocompromised state (diabetes), melioidosis due to Burkholderia pseudomallei was a primary consideration. Tuberculosis was less likely as tuberculous abscesses are usually 'cold' and less inflamed. Disseminated fungal infection was considered unlikely without other forms of immunosuppression.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and gentamicin. After 48 hours, when cultures indicated melioidosis, therapy was switched to ceftazidime. The patient improved and was afebrile by day 14, at which point he was transitioned to oral co-trimoxazole. His diabetes was brought under control. He was discharged after 21 days to complete a 20-week course of antibiotics and continued oral eradication treatment for 5 months, and he remains well.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated melioidosis presenting with sepsis, a skin and soft tissue abscess, and pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions. The diagnosis was confirmed by the growth of the causative agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, from both pus and blood cultures. The clinical picture and significant risk factors, including poorly controlled diabetes and occupational exposure as a rice farmer in an endemic region, strongly supported this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Melioidosis\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.811)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.808)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis""]","Diagnosis: Histoplasmosis
Reason: The patient presented with a large, tense, fluctuant swelling on the dorsum of his left hand, which is characteristic of a histoplasmosis abscess. The high white blood cell count with a neutrophilic predominance and the presence of bluish skin discoloration are also consistent with histoplasmosis. The patient's history of being bitten by a snake and the presence of a significant fluid collection on ultrasound are also suggestive of histoplasmosis.","The diagnosis is severe local complications from a snake bite, specifically a hand abscess and digital gangrene. This is supported by the patient's history of a snake bite four days prior with a delayed presentation and no antivenom administration. Clinical evidence included fever, a large fluctuant swelling on the hand, and black discoloration of the finger, indicative of tissue necrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound showing an abscess, which required surgical incision and drainage, debridement, and ultimately, amputation of the gangrenous digit.",0.5734562973845239,0.125,0.0
"A 34-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with a two-week illness. His symptoms began with epigastric pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and fevers up to 39°C. One week into the illness, he developed right-sided pleuritic chest pain. On the day of admission, his symptoms persisted, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The imaging revealed hepatomegaly and a large, heterogeneous liver lesion measuring 13.4 x 3.6 cm.","[""## Case 46---A-45-Year-Old-Man-from-Sri-Lanka-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro (score=0.831)\n**Patient Information**: A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man whose past medical history is unremarkable, but he admits to consuming locally brewed alcohol ('toddy') daily for the past 10 to 15 years. He was well before the current illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, chills, headache, body aches, and severe right hypochondrial pain for one week.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past week, the patient has experienced fever, chills, headache, body aches, and severe right hypochondrial pain. He also developed a dry cough in the past few days, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and is exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Sri Lanka and has a 10 to 15-year history of daily consumption of 'toddy', a locally brewed alcohol made from coconut flowers. The text notes that this specific alcoholic drink is locally known to be linked with amoebiasis, possibly through contamination of the clay containers used for collection. The case occurs in an Asian setting where amoebiasis, hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and melioidosis are endemic considerations.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, the temperature was 38.3°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared generally ill, mildly dehydrated, and in pain. There was no jaundice, pallor, or lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed a tender hepatomegaly, with the most prominent tenderness located over the 6th to 9th intercostal spaces in the right mid-axillary line. The spleen was not enlarged. Lung auscultation revealed a few inspiratory crackles over the right lung base. The cardiovascular and nervous systems were clinically normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory investigations revealed a leukocytosis (WBC 14.7 ×10^9/L), elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 48 mg/L), and abnormal liver function tests with a disproportionately elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP 446 U/L) and mildly elevated transaminases (AST 54 U/L, ALT 38 U/L). A chest radiograph showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm and patchy shadows in the right lower zone. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall measuring 7x6 cm in the right liver lobe, along with a small right-sided pleural effusion. Aspiration of the lesion yielded brownish pus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was between an amoebic and a pyogenic liver abscess. An amoebic liver abscess was considered more likely given the epidemiological setting, the patient's age, lack of comorbidities, and the known association with 'toddy' consumption. Pyogenic abscess, particularly from hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae, was also a consideration due to its prevalence in Southeast Asia. Melioidosis was another differential, as it is endemic in Sri Lanka and can cause organ abscesses, with alcoholism being a risk factor. Infectious hepatitis was deemed less likely due to only slightly elevated transaminases and the absence of jaundice.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Due to its large size, the liver lesion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance. The patient was treated with metronidazole for ten days. He responded well to this management, making a rapid and uneventful recovery.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is amoebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This was strongly suggested by the clinical picture of fever and right upper quadrant pain, physical findings of tender hepatomegaly and intercostal tenderness, and imaging showing a large, solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm. The diagnosis was further supported by the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus' (necrotic liver tissue) and the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy, a standard treatment for amoebiasis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Amoebic liver abscess\n\n## Case 1---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sudan-With-Fever--_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropi (score=0.806)\n**Patient Information**: The patient is a 20-year-old housewife, a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.\n**Vitals**: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Ebola virus disease\n\n## Case 52---A-56-Year-Old-Man-from-Peru-With-Prolonged-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.798)\n**Patient Information**: A 56-year-old male Peruvian with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-week history of fever, jaundice, and confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's daily fever started three months after spending three weeks in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru. In the second week of the illness, he noticed dark urine and jaundice. A few days before admission, his wife noted the onset of confusion and somnolence.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Three months prior to his illness, the patient had a three-week vacation in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru at an altitude of 2400 m. While there, he and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes and did not use any personal protection. No animal contact was reported.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2°C (102.6°F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared confused and disorientated, with a GCS of 14/15, but had no focal neurological findings or meningeal signs. His skin and conjunctivae were markedly pale, and scleral jaundice was present. The liver was slightly enlarged, but there was no splenomegaly. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results revealed severe anemia (Hemoglobin 6 g/dL) with evidence of hemolysis, including high reticulocytes (8%), elevated LDH (1500 U/L), and hyperbilirubinemia (Total 239 µmol/L, Direct 103 µmol/L). The white blood cell count was elevated at 14.9 x 10^9/L with neutrophilia, and platelets were high at 454 x 10^9/L. The Coomb's test was negative. Creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, and CSF results were all normal. A CT scan of the brain was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with no focal lesions. Blood films for malaria were negative, but a thin film showed massive red blood cell infestation by pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures compatible with *B. bacilliformis*. Blood cultures, including those on special media for Bartonella, were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and bartonellosis. *Plasmodium vivax* was a possibility, given the features of severe anemia, jaundice, and impaired consciousness, but this species is not typically associated with severe malaria. Bartonellosis was a strong consideration due to the travel history to the Peruvian highlands where sandfly vectors are present. Less common considerations included rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, brucellosis, and viral hepatitis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition progressed to shock, requiring transfer to the ICU for vasopressor treatment. He was started on a 10-day course of intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. His altered mental status resolved after 3 days of antimicrobial therapy, and his fever subsided after 5 days. By day 4, the bacteria were no longer visible on blood smears. He experienced no further complications and was well at a 3-month follow-up.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is acute bartonellosis (Oroya fever) caused by infection with *Bartonella bacilliformis*. This was confirmed by the microscopic finding of massive red blood cell infestation with pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures on a thin blood smear. The clinical syndrome of prolonged fever, severe hemolytic anemia, and neurologic compromise, along with the specific travel history to an endemic region in the Peruvian Andes, is characteristic of this disease. Malaria was appropriately ruled out by negative blood films.\n**Disease Name Short**: Bartonellosis\n\n## Case 79---A-34-Year-Old-Male-Immigrant-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.786)\n**Patient Information**: A 34-year-old man, originally from northern Peru, who has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He has a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively. His Peruvian wife and children are reported as healthy at presentation.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea with colicky abdominal pain and a weight loss of approximately 20 kg.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. For over 12 years, he has suffered from recurrent, less severe episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but the frequency of these episodes has increased over the past 2 years.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is an immigrant from northern Peru, a tropical region described as highly endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. He has resided in Chile for the last 9 years. His family history is notable for two close relatives (mother and brother) dying from wasting syndromes of unknown origin. Later investigation revealed his wife had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and was also HTLV-1 positive; one of his two children also had an asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection but was HTLV-1 negative.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient is cachectic with severe loss of muscle mass, a body weight of 44 kg, and a BMI of 17. Abdominal examination revealed slight pain on palpation. Otherwise, the physical examination was normal, with no fever, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable lymphadenopathy, and no peripheral oedema.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis (WBC 11.7 x 10^9/L), thrombocytosis (platelets 644 x 10^9/L), mild anemia (haemoglobin 12.4 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (protein 4.9 g/dL), and an elevated ESR (26 mm/h). An HIV test was negative. Abdominal CT and MRI scans were without pathological findings, and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was macroscopically normal. However, histology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with elongated structures compatible with a helminth infection. Subsequent Baermann testing of a fresh stool sample demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis, and larvae were also found in respiratory secretions. Serology confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea and wasting in this patient centered on helminth infections. The two main considerations were Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis. Intestinal protozoa like Cryptosporidium or Cystoisospora belli were also a possibility, though less likely in an HIV-negative patient. Given the patient's origin from a region highly endemic for S. stercoralis, this was considered the most probable cause.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was hospitalized and stabilized with symptomatic treatment and parenteral nutrition. Following the diagnosis, he was treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day for 7 days), which was repeated after a 2-week interval. He recovered from his diarrhea and abdominal symptoms within weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, he had gained 13 kg, was free of postprandial cramps for the first time in over 10 years, and parasitological examination was negative. His wife and one child were also found to have asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection and were presumably treated.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann technique) and respiratory secretions. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a known risk factor, HTLV-1 co-infection (confirmed by serology), and the patient's geographic origin from an endemic area. The clinical picture of severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, along with the dramatic response to ivermectin, solidified the diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome""]","Diagnosis: Tropical pulmonary edema
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including hepatomegaly and a large, heterogeneous liver lesion, are characteristic of tropical pulmonary edema. This condition is commonly seen in tropical regions and is caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, hypovolemia, and infection. The patient's age and the presence of hepatomegaly suggest a tropical origin, which is consistent with the diagnosis of tropical pulmonary edema.","The diagnosis is an amebic liver abscess, caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The clinical presentation of a subacute febrile illness with right upper quadrant pain is classic. The ultrasound finding of a large, solitary liver lesion in this clinical context is highly suggestive. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by positive serology for E. histolytica antibodies, which are highly sensitive for extraintestinal disease.",0.2143089292581282,0.1,0.9999999999
"A 70-year-old man from Peru presented with a six-year history of a slowly expanding, painless skin lesion on his left foot. The lesion initially appeared as a small, non-pruritic papule on the dorsum of the foot. Over the course of several years, this papule became ulcerated and failed to heal. The patient has no other significant past medical history and sought evaluation for this chronic, non-healing ulcer.","[""## Case 34---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-a-Chro_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.840)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The patient was previously healthy.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on his left arm.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Two months before presentation, the patient suffered a scratch on his left hand from a tree branch while working. A few days later, a small painless erythematous papule appeared, which later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks, new pustules appeared, the lesion ulcerated and increased in size despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule, he noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. He was seen at a regional hospital and treated empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials but showed no improvement, leading to a referral.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The initial lesion was caused by a scratch from a tree branch while working in the fields. He denied recent contact with animals or travel.\n**Vitals**: The patient's vital signs are normal and he is afebrile.\n**Physical Exam**: On the left hand, there is a single ulcerative lesion (20 × 30 mm) with irregular elevated borders and multiple subcutaneous erythematous nodules (10 × 10 mm) along the lymphatic tract of the left arm. The rest of the physical examination is normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a WBC of 4.5 × 10^9/L with a normal differential count and mild anaemia with a haemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL. A chest x-ray and PPD skin test were normal and negative, respectively. Direct microscopy for leishmania parasites and a leishmanin skin test were negative. Mycobacterial cultures were also negative. Definitive diagnosis was established when culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, and mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or M. marinum). Leishmaniasis was considered highly suggestive by the patient's origin and presentation, but the lack of response to a full course of pentavalent antimonials made it unlikely. Sporotrichosis was considered a top diagnosis due to the typical clinical features. Other causes like Nocardiosis and tularaemia were considered unlikely due to geographic rarity.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial empiric treatments with antibiotics, topical traditional medicines, and a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials for suspected leishmaniasis all failed to produce improvement. Following the definitive diagnosis, the patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg/day orally. After 8 months of treatment, the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved, and the patient was considered cured.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. This was confirmed by the positive culture of S. schenckii from both ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration specimens. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic clinical syndrome of a primary ulcer with nodular lymphangitis (sporotrichoid spread) following traumatic inoculation with plant matter in an agricultural worker. Other key diagnoses like leishmaniasis and tuberculosis were ruled out by negative specific tests and, in the case of leishmaniasis, therapeutic failure.\n**Disease Name Short**: Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis\n\n## Case 2---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-Peru-With-a-Chron_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.829)\n**Patient Information**: A 7-year-old girl residing in Lima, Peru, who is described as otherwise healthy.\n**Chief Complaint**: A chronic skin lesion on the nose, present for 4 months.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The lesion began 4 months prior as a small nodule on the nose that slowly evolved into an ulcer. It is described as being slightly itchy but not painful. There was no history of trauma to the area.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in Lima, Peru. Six months prior to presentation, she travelled to a valley on the western slopes of the Andes. The patient lives in a poor neighborhood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, though she did not travel to a region known to be hyperendemic for sporotrichosis.\n**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs are reported.\n**Physical Exam**: A localized ulcer is present on the nose, measuring about 2 cm in diameter. The ulcer has indurated borders with plaque-like infiltration of the surrounding skin. Upon removal of a scab, the ulcer base was revealed to have a cobblestone-patterned bottom and raised edges. There are no palpable lymph nodes, and the rest of the physical examination is normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Microscopic examination of a scraping from the lesion was negative for amastigotes. However, the leishmanin skin test was positive. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was also positive, and identified the infecting species as Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. Common bacterial infections, cutaneous anthrax, and tularemia were considered less likely due to the chronic nature, location, and lack of associated symptoms like edema. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was considered the most likely diagnosis due to the frequency of the disease in the valley the patient travelled to and the characteristic presentation of a localized, painless ulcer with raised edges.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with intravenous sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 20 days. She also received topical imiquimod therapy every other day for 20 days. The response to treatment was good, and at a three-month follow-up, she showed no signs of relapse.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana. This was definitively confirmed by a positive leishmanin skin test and a positive PCR test which identified the specific species. The clinical presentation of a chronic, painless ulcer with raised edges on the nose following travel to an endemic area in the Andes is characteristic of this disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cutaneous leishmaniasis\n\n## Case 62---A-28-Year-Old-Man-from-Ghana-With-a-Chron_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.809)\n**Patient Information**: A 28-year-old West African man from Ghana, described as short for an adult. He has a history of a previous ulcer on his right ankle some years ago which took about a year to heal.\n**Chief Complaint**: A painful, non-healing ulcer on his left ankle for the past 4 months.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents with a painful ulcer on his left ankle which has been present for 4 months and is not healing. There is no history of prior trauma. He reports a similar ulcer on his right ankle years prior that took a year to heal. He also complains of pain in his right thigh and in both knees.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a West African man living in Ghana. His occupation as a self-employed individual is noted as it made enforcing strict bed rest difficult. The case takes place in a setting where sickle cell disease is a common hereditary disorder.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs on presentation were: Temperature 36.6°C, pulse 88 bpm, and blood pressure 110/70 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient is short for an adult, pale, and has a tinge of jaundice. There is an ulcer on his left ankle, next to the medial malleolus, with surrounding hyperpigmentation. Tenderness is noted in both knee joints and in his right thigh. The rest of the physical examination is reported as normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial labs showed a white blood cell count of 17.6×10^9/L, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, adequate platelets, and a normal fasting blood glucose of 4.8 mmol/L. A peripheral blood film showed irreversibly sickled cells, polychromasia, target cells, and nucleated red cells. A sickling test was positive, and haemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed homozygous HbSS-type disease. A wound swab grew Pseudomonas species sensitive to levofloxacin. Radiography of the left leg showed a periosteal reaction with slightly sclerotic bones.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was for the chronic leg ulcer. A venous ulcer was considered, but the presence of bone pain, jaundice, and pallor pointed toward a haemolytic anaemia. Various hereditary haemolytic anaemias were considered, including haemoglobinopathies like thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, spherocytosis, and pyruvate kinase deficiency, with sickle cell disease being the most likely diagnosis in the West African context. Other possibilities included tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, chronic osteomyelitis, Buruli ulcer (usually painless), other mycobacterial infections, pyoderma gangrenosum, and malignant diseases.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was managed with alternate daily wound dressing using normal saline irrigation and povidone-iodine, along with systemic antibiotics for the Pseudomonas wound infection. His recurrent bone pain was managed with hydration, prompt treatment of infections, paracetamol, and tramadol. He also received daily folic acid supplementation. Strict bed rest was difficult to enforce. At 3 years follow-up, the ulcer was still not healed, and grafting was considered. Six years later, the ulcer remained unhealed as the patient could not afford a skin graft, though his WBC had normalized and his hemoglobin had slightly increased.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is sickle cell disease, specifically homozygous HbSS-type, complicated by a chronic ankle ulcer. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive sickling test and haemoglobin electrophoresis. The clinical presentation of a young West African man with pallor, jaundice, bone pain, and a history of chronic, non-healing leg ulcers is characteristic of the condition. Laboratory findings of anaemia and a peripheral smear with sickled red cells provided strong supporting evidence.\n**Disease Name Short**: Sickle cell disease\n\n## Case 25---A-72-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Laos-With-Exte_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.802)\n**Patient Information**: A 72-year-old male farmer from northern Laos. No underlying comorbidities or immunosuppression were reported. Liver function tests and serum glucose remained normal during treatment.\n**Chief Complaint**: Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on the left foot and lower leg, with acute swelling and pain for three days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The condition began ten years prior, following a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week after the bite, a small painless red nodule developed at the site. Over the subsequent years, the lesion slowly enlarged, and further cauliflower-like and plaque-like lesions developed, spreading up to his knee. Three days before admission, his ankle became acutely painful and swollen, prompting him to seek care.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer residing in northern Laos. The initial lesion developed at the site of a leech bite ten years ago, suggesting traumatic inoculation in an agricultural setting. The causative agents for this condition are typically found in plant debris or forest detritus, and male agricultural workers are the most commonly affected demographic.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal, and the patient was afebrile upon admission.\n**Physical Exam**: The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and hot skin. There were multiple cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were described as partly erythematous, partly fungating, and purulent, with a bad odour.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Radiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement. Bacterial culture of pus from the lesions grew Escherichia coli. Direct microscopic investigation of wet film skin scrapings revealed characteristic brownish, round, thick-walled, multiseptate sclerotic cells typical of chromoblastomycosis, which were made more visible with 10% potassium hydroxide solution. PCR from skin tissue was positive, and sequencing showed 100% similarity with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora, and F. nubica.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for chronic verrucous skin lesions included fungal infections like sporotrichosis and mycetoma, as well as mycobacterial infections such as cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and Kaposi's Sarcoma were also considered. Non-infectious causes like squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis were possibilities. The acute signs of pain, swelling, and purulence suggested a secondary bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A secondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and treated with local iodine-based antiseptics and initial oral antibiotics (cloxacillin and metronidazole), which were later changed to co-trimoxazole based on culture sensitivities. Antifungal treatment was initiated with itraconazole (400 mg/d for 7 days, monthly pulse therapy) along with surgical debridement. Later, oral terbinafine (500-750 mg/d for 9 months) and local terbinafine ointment were added. The lesions healed uneventfully, leaving some residual swelling and hypopigmentation.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection. This was confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of brownish, round, multiseptate sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies') on direct microscopy of skin scrapings. The causative agent was identified by PCR and sequencing as Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, F. nubica). The clinical presentation of slowly progressive verrucous lesions on a lower limb following minor trauma in a farmer is classic for this disease. The patient also had a secondary bacterial superinfection with E. coli, which was successfully treated.\n**Disease Name Short**: Chromoblastomycosis""]","Diagnosis: Chromoblastomycosis
Reason: The patient's history of a slowly expanding, painless skin lesion on his left foot, which has been present for six years, is consistent with the clinical presentation of chromoblastomycosis. The characteristic pathognomonic finding of brownish, round, multiseptate sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies') on direct microscopy of skin scrapings is a key diagnostic feature of this disease. Additionally, the patient's history of a chronic, non-healing ulcer, along with the presence of a secondary bacterial superinfection, supports the diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis.","The diagnosis is Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. This is supported by the extremely chronic (six-year) history of a slowly progressive, painless, ulcerative skin lesion in a patient from Peru, an endemic area for the disease. The evolution from a papule to a non-healing ulcer is a classic presentation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by identifying Leishmania amastigotes in a skin biopsy or smear, or by PCR.",0.21592153923584004,1.0,0.0

He has not yet started antiretroviral medication. He has no history of previous tuberculosis. His wife is also HIV-positive.\n**Chief Complaint**: Progressing dark skin spots for one month, new facial swelling, and a three-month history of cough and worsening shortness of breath.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past month, the patient noticed dark spots on his arm and leg that were progressing, and he subsequently developed facial swelling. He also reports a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum accompanied by worsening shortness of breath. He denied any constitutional symptoms, including weight loss, fevers, or night sweats.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a businessman from Malawi. His wife is also HIV-positive, and his two young children have not yet been tested. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 36°C (96.8°F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was comfortable at rest with moderate facial oedema. Examination revealed widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Respiratory assessment showed decreased air entry and dullness at the right lung base. His right leg was swollen from the foot to the knee, with prominent, coalescing dark plaques. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The patient was confirmed to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. His hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and MCV was 88.4 fL. Sputum microscopy and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests were negative for tuberculosis. A chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifications with peribronchovascular changes in the lower and mid lung zones, noted as being typical for pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses were Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and pulmonary tuberculosis. The skin and palatal lesions were described as typical for KS, strongly suggesting the diagnosis and raising suspicion for pulmonary involvement. Tuberculosis was considered essential to rule out in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient with a chronic cough, especially as dual pathology with KS is not uncommon.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's primary concern was shortness of breath. Investigations for tuberculosis were negative. A bronchoscopy was attempted but failed due to technical difficulties. He received a short course of oral antibiotics with no improvement. He was subsequently referred to start antiretroviral medication and palliative chemotherapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Kaposi's sarcoma with extensive cutaneous, palatal, and pulmonary involvement, occurring in the context of advanced, untreated HIV infection (AIDS). The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical findings of widespread purplish plaques, a low CD4 count (134 cells/µL), and chest X-ray findings typical for pulmonary KS. Tuberculosis was actively considered and reasonably excluded based on negative sputum and GeneXpert tests.\n**Disease Name Short**: Kaposi's sarcoma\n\n## Case 94---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Democratic-Republic-_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.801)\n**Patient Information**: A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children. Notably, she was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programs were stopped in the early 1980s.\n**Chief Complaint**: A history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and neck swelling, followed by a disseminated skin rash.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever, malaise, headache, and a dry cough. Two days later, a disseminated skin rash appeared, beginning on her face and spreading centrifugally to her body, including the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. The skin lesions evolved from macules to papules, then vesicles, and finally to pustules. The oral lesions were painful, making it difficult to eat and drink.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural agricultural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area where monkeypox is endemic. She is part of a population with waning herd immunity to orthopoxviruses, as she was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A specific animal or human contact was not identified, which is common in such settings.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed disseminated, uniform, umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, with a predilection for the face, hands, and feet. There was generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen, and central nervous system was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results at presentation included a White Blood Cell count of 4.4 x 10^9/L (73% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and an elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. The diagnosis was made clinically, as definitive laboratory testing such as PCR or culture is often unavailable in endemic regions.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this vesiculopustular rash included poxvirus infections. Monkeypox was the main suspicion due to the endemic location, rash characteristics, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Varicella was also considered but is less likely given the uniform stage of the lesions and palm/sole involvement. Cowpox was deemed unlikely as it usually presents with a single lesion and uncommonly causes significant fever or lymphadenopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Management was exclusively supportive, as no specific treatment is available for monkeypox. The patient made an uneventful recovery but was left with scarring from the skin lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is human monkeypox, made on clinical grounds. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile prodrome followed by a characteristic centrifugal, vesiculopustular rash with lesions in a uniform stage of development, including on the palms and soles. The presence of prominent lymphadenopathy and the patient's residence in an endemic area of the DRC further support this diagnosis over differentials like varicella. Her age indicates she was not vaccinated against smallpox, increasing her susceptibility.\n**Disease Name Short**: Human monkeypox\n\n## Case 5---A-4-Year-Old-Boy-from-Laos-With-a-Lesion-o_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.797)\n**Patient Information**: A 4-year-old, unimmunized boy from a remote village in Laos, described as chronically malnourished, stunted, and thin. He had a history of a fever and rash approximately 2 months prior to presentation, from which he recovered.\n**Chief Complaint**: A rapidly progressing dark sore on the cheek, first noticed three days prior to presentation.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Three days ago, the family noticed a dark sore on the child's cheek. The lesion progressed quickly to eat through the cheek. Associated symptoms include bad breath, listlessness, and anorexia. The family is very poor, and local doctors did not recognize the disease.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The child lives in a remote village in a poor developing country in Laos. He is unimmunized and his immune system is compromised by malnutrition and a recent infection (fever and rash 2 months prior), which are known risk factors for noma.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: The child appears small, quiet, stunted, and thin. There is a gangrenous, necrotizing lesion on the right cheek that has destroyed part of his upper and lower lips, exposing his teeth. His breath smells bad.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: No diagnostic laboratory tests were performed, as the diagnosis was made clinically.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included tooth abscess and cellulitis, but the rapid destruction of tissue is typical of noma. Other ulcerating facial lesions such as oral cancer, syphilis, and yaws were considered unlikely in a young child. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was deemed unlikely to develop so rapidly and destructively. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, while destructive, is non-endemic in Laos.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The child was treated with penicillin and metronidazole to cover suspected aerobic and anaerobic oropharyngeal bacteria, along with nutritional support. Necrotic tissue was removed. His face healed with contractures, resulting in disfigurement and salivary incontinence. At age 9, he was referred for surgery by a visiting surgical team and underwent two successful surgeries that improved his appearance and corrected the salivary incontinence.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is noma, an opportunistic infection. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the presence of a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face in a chronically malnourished, unimmunized child from a resource-poor setting. The clinical presentation is characteristic of noma, and other potential diagnoses were deemed less likely due to the patient's age and the lesion's features.\n**Disease Name Short**: Noma\n\n## Case 34---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-a-Chro_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.793)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The patient was previously healthy.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on his left arm.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Two months before presentation, the patient suffered a scratch on his left hand from a tree branch while working. A few days later, a small painless erythematous papule appeared, which later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks, new pustules appeared, the lesion ulcerated and increased in size despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule, he noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. He was seen at a regional hospital and treated empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials but showed no improvement, leading to a referral.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from the Peruvian highlands. The initial lesion was caused by a scratch from a tree branch while working in the fields. He denied recent contact with animals or travel.\n**Vitals**: The patient's vital signs are normal and he is afebrile.\n**Physical Exam**: On the left hand, there is a single ulcerative lesion (20 × 30 mm) with irregular elevated borders and multiple subcutaneous erythematous nodules (10 × 10 mm) along the lymphatic tract of the left arm. The rest of the physical examination is normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a WBC of 4.5 × 10^9/L with a normal differential count and mild anaemia with a haemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL. A chest x-ray and PPD skin test were normal and negative, respectively. Direct microscopy for leishmania parasites and a leishmanin skin test were negative. Mycobacterial cultures were also negative. Definitive diagnosis was established when culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, and mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or M. marinum). Leishmaniasis was considered highly suggestive by the patient's origin and presentation, but the lack of response to a full course of pentavalent antimonials made it unlikely. Sporotrichosis was considered a top diagnosis due to the typical clinical features. Other causes like Nocardiosis and tularaemia were considered unlikely due to geographic rarity.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial empiric treatments with antibiotics, topical traditional medicines, and a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials for suspected leishmaniasis all failed to produce improvement. Following the definitive diagnosis, the patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg/day orally. After 8 months of treatment, the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved, and the patient was considered cured.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. This was confirmed by the positive culture of S. schenckii from both ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration specimens. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the classic clinical syndrome of a primary ulcer with nodular lymphangitis (sporotrichoid spread) following traumatic inoculation with plant matter in an agricultural worker. Other key diagnoses like leishmaniasis and tuberculosis were ruled out by negative specific tests and, in the case of leishmaniasis, therapeutic failure.\n**Disease Name Short**: Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis""]","Diagnosis: Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia
Reason: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, a condition characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the blood and lungs. The patient's age, primary symptoms, and the presence of multiple ulcerative and granulomatous lesions in the oropharynx and lungs are all indicative of this condition. The chest radiograph also shows bilateral, mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, which are typical of this condition.","The final diagnosis is chronic paracoccidioidomycosis. This is supported by the patient's epidemiology (male agricultural worker from an endemic area in Brazil), the chronicity of the illness, and the classic clinical presentation involving both the lungs and the oral mucosa (mulberry-like stomatitis). The diagnosis is confirmed by direct microscopic examination of a biopsy from an oral lesion or a sputum sample, which reveals the characteristic large, multiple-budding yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, often described as a ""mariner's wheel.""",0.21417977855535383,0.8666666666666667,0.9999999999
"An 18-year-old female presents with a five-day history of abrupt onset fever, shaking chills, generalized malaise, headache, and myalgias. She also reports nausea, vomiting, and dark urine that began two days prior to admission. Her symptoms began eight days after she returned from an 8-day trip to a jungle region in Iquitos, Peru. During her trip, she slept in tents, swam in a river, and had inconsistent use of mosquito repellents and nets. On examination, she is febrile to 38°C and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm. The exam is notable for tenderness to palpation in both abdominal flanks, but no jaundice, rash, or signs of bleeding are present.

In the second week of the illness, he noticed dark urine and jaundice. A few days before admission, his wife noted the onset of confusion and somnolence.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Three months prior to his illness, the patient had a three-week vacation in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru at an altitude of 2400 m. While there, he and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes and did not use any personal protection. No animal contact was reported.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2°C (102.6°F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared confused and disorientated, with a GCS of 14/15, but had no focal neurological findings or meningeal signs. His skin and conjunctivae were markedly pale, and scleral jaundice was present. The liver was slightly enlarged, but there was no splenomegaly. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results revealed severe anemia (Hemoglobin 6 g/dL) with evidence of hemolysis, including high reticulocytes (8%), elevated LDH (1500 U/L), and hyperbilirubinemia (Total 239 µmol/L, Direct 103 µmol/L). The white blood cell count was elevated at 14.9 x 10^9/L with neutrophilia, and platelets were high at 454 x 10^9/L. The Coomb's test was negative. Creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, and CSF results were all normal. A CT scan of the brain was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with no focal lesions. Blood films for malaria were negative, but a thin film showed massive red blood cell infestation by pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures compatible with *B. bacilliformis*. Blood cultures, including those on special media for Bartonella, were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and bartonellosis. *Plasmodium vivax* was a possibility, given the features of severe anemia, jaundice, and impaired consciousness, but this species is not typically associated with severe malaria. Bartonellosis was a strong consideration due to the travel history to the Peruvian highlands where sandfly vectors are present. Less common considerations included rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, brucellosis, and viral hepatitis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition progressed to shock, requiring transfer to the ICU for vasopressor treatment. He was started on a 10-day course of intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. His altered mental status resolved after 3 days of antimicrobial therapy, and his fever subsided after 5 days. By day 4, the bacteria were no longer visible on blood smears. He experienced no further complications and was well at a 3-month follow-up.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is acute bartonellosis (Oroya fever) caused by infection with *Bartonella bacilliformis*. This was confirmed by the microscopic finding of massive red blood cell infestation with pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures on a thin blood smear. The clinical syndrome of prolonged fever, severe hemolytic anemia, and neurologic compromise, along with the specific travel history to an endemic region in the Peruvian Andes, is characteristic of this disease. Malaria was appropriately ruled out by negative blood films.\n**Disease Name Short**: Bartonellosis\n\n## Case 20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.827)\n**Patient Information**: A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation. He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.818)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 1---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sudan-With-Fever--_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropi (score=0.816)\n**Patient Information**: The patient is a 20-year-old housewife, a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.\n**Vitals**: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Ebola virus disease""]","Diagnosis: Bartonellosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Bartonellosis, including the presence of pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures on a thin blood smear, which is characteristic of Bartonella species. Additionally, the patient's travel history to an endemic region in the Peruvian Andes, where sandfly vectors are present, supports the diagnosis of Bartonellosis.","The diagnosis is uncomplicated malaria, caused by Plasmodium vivax. The key evidence includes the classic clinical syndrome of abrupt fever, chills, malaise, and headache. This occurred within a typical incubation period (8 days) after travel to a highly malaria-endemic area (Iquitos, Peru) with significant mosquito exposure. The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying Plasmodium parasites on a thick and thin peripheral blood smear or by a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT).",0.2102264489007889,1.0,0.0

HIV antibody testing was negative. He has no other reported significant medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A mobile, itchy mass under the skin, which has been migrating for three weeks.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Three weeks ago, the patient first noted a mass in his groin that subsided after four days. He then developed an itchy, serpiginous rash that tracked from his groin to his chest, moved over several days, and then disappeared. The mass subsequently reappeared on his right shoulder, prompting him to seek assessment. There was no history of fever or systemic illness.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Five weeks prior to presentation, the patient returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. During the trip, he swam in fresh river water and ate freshwater fish from the river, which he later admitted included making sushi. Two of the four friends who accompanied him had the same complaint. The patient took malaria chemoprophylaxis and slept under a mosquito net. He denies any sexual contact on the trip.\n**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Organ system examination was normal. On his right upper deltoid, there was a firm mass with clear margins, measuring 3 x 8 cm. A serpiginous tract was visible, and the mass had reportedly migrated recently across his upper chest wall. There was no additional rash and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a total white cell count of 8.9 ×10^9/L and a significant peripheral eosinophilia with an eosinophil count of 0.9 × 10^9/L (reference <0.5). Liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. HIV antibody testing was negative. Serology for Gnathostoma was negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was gnathostomiasis, given the classic presentation of a mobile subcutaneous mass, creeping eruption, and eosinophilia. Other parasitic causes were considered, including Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), which was deemed unlikely as it is not endemic to the exposure area and has a longer incubation period. Sparganosis, another cause of migratory swelling, was considered very rare. Cutaneous larva migrans from hookworms and Strongyloides were also considered less likely as they typically cause fine tracks, not a large mobile mass.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous gnathostomiasis was made, and treatment was initiated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 21 days and a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg. During the first six days of treatment, the lesion migrated over his shoulder and neck, disappeared for 24 hours, then reappeared between his eyebrows, moved to his forehead and face, and was felt inside his nose. On the sixth day, the patient expressed a larva from his nostril, which was identified as Gnathostoma spinigerum. His two symptomatic friends were also treated and had full resolution of their symptoms.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous gnathostomiasis caused by the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum. This was confirmed by the direct identification of the larva after it was expressed from the patient's nostril. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical syndrome of a migratory subcutaneous mass (larva migrans profundus), significant eosinophilia, and a history of consuming raw freshwater fish in an endemic area (Botswana). The initial negative serology does not rule out the disease, which was proven parasitologically.\n**Disease Name Short**: Gnathostomiasis\n\n## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.795)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 94---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Democratic-Republic-_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.787)\n**Patient Information**: A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children. Notably, she was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programs were stopped in the early 1980s.\n**Chief Complaint**: A history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and neck swelling, followed by a disseminated skin rash.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever, malaise, headache, and a dry cough. Two days later, a disseminated skin rash appeared, beginning on her face and spreading centrifugally to her body, including the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. The skin lesions evolved from macules to papules, then vesicles, and finally to pustules. The oral lesions were painful, making it difficult to eat and drink.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural agricultural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area where monkeypox is endemic. She is part of a population with waning herd immunity to orthopoxviruses, as she was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A specific animal or human contact was not identified, which is common in such settings.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed disseminated, uniform, umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, with a predilection for the face, hands, and feet. There was generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen, and central nervous system was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results at presentation included a White Blood Cell count of 4.4 x 10^9/L (73% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and an elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. The diagnosis was made clinically, as definitive laboratory testing such as PCR or culture is often unavailable in endemic regions.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this vesiculopustular rash included poxvirus infections. Monkeypox was the main suspicion due to the endemic location, rash characteristics, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Varicella was also considered but is less likely given the uniform stage of the lesions and palm/sole involvement. Cowpox was deemed unlikely as it usually presents with a single lesion and uncommonly causes significant fever or lymphadenopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Management was exclusively supportive, as no specific treatment is available for monkeypox. The patient made an uneventful recovery but was left with scarring from the skin lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is human monkeypox, made on clinical grounds. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile prodrome followed by a characteristic centrifugal, vesiculopustular rash with lesions in a uniform stage of development, including on the palms and soles. The presence of prominent lymphadenopathy and the patient's residence in an endemic area of the DRC further support this diagnosis over differentials like varicella. Her age indicates she was not vaccinated against smallpox, increasing her susceptibility.\n**Disease Name Short**: Human monkeypox\n\n## Case 21---A-35-Year-Old-American-Man-With-Fatigue-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.784)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Caucasian male with an unremarkable past medical history. He works as a postal worker and has had no foreign travel within the previous year or contact with animals.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fatigue and a neck lesion that started as a papule two days prior.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a rash on his neck that began as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before its onset while shaving. He had been seen in a clinic 24 hours prior and was discharged on an oral cephalosporin, but returned due to worsening malaise, neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a postal worker in the United States with no recent foreign travel, contact with animals, or known insect bites. The case occurred during an investigation into a bioterrorism event, and his exposure was later determined to be from handling contaminated mail during his occupation.\n**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His neck circumference had increased from a baseline of 57 cm to a peak of 81 cm.\n**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed a 2 cm irregularly shaped, indurated, non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema which made lymph node assessment difficult. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, were normal except for a mildly elevated hemoglobin at 18.7 g/dL. Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. A subsequent Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion were negative for B. anthracis. However, a skin biopsy sent to a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed the presence of B. anthracis antigens. Convalescent serology revealed the presence of antibodies to protective antigen.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for an ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. Given the ongoing bioterrorism investigation in the United States at the time, cutaneous anthrax was the most important diagnosis to consider, supported by the presence of a painless papule evolving into an ulcer with extensive, non-tender edema and systemic symptoms without significant fever.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with a first-generation cephalosporin but his condition worsened. Upon his return to the clinic, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam. Following this treatment regimen, the patient recovered.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a skin biopsy which showed abundant B. anthracis antigens, and by serology showing antibodies to protective antigen in convalescent serum. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's clinical picture of a painless ulcer with massive edema and his occupational exposure as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a known bioterrorism event.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cutaneous anthrax""]","Diagnosis: Tropical dermatitis
Reason: The patient's primary symptoms of scaly skin lesions spread across his body and severe and persistent itching are characteristic of tropical dermatitis. This condition is commonly seen in tropical regions and is characterized by pruritic, scaly skin lesions that can be spread across the body. The patient's age and the progression of the condition over multiple months are also consistent with tropical dermatitis.","The diagnosis is crusted scabies, a severe hyperinfestation with the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis*. The long duration of symptoms (7 months), widespread scaly lesions, and severe pruritus in an elderly patient are highly suggestive of this condition. Unlike classic scabies, crusted scabies is characterized by thick crusts and an extremely high mite burden. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings to identify numerous mites, eggs, or scybala.",0.2177126796213914,0.2,0.0

She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.\n**Vitals**: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Ebola virus disease\n\n## Case 13---A-16-Year-Old-Girl-from-Malawi-With-Fever_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.776)\n**Patient Information**: A 16-year-old Malawian girl who delivered a baby 5 months prior. An HIV test performed during her antenatal care was negative. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She is in a fair nutritional state.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache for the past 5 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient, a 16-year-old girl, presented to a local hospital with a 5-day history of fever, generalized abdominal pain, and frontal headache. No other details on the progression of the illness are provided.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives with her parents, three siblings, and her baby in an urban, high-density area in Malawi. The household has no running water or electricity, and the family fetches water from a community tap. She recently dropped out of primary school during her pregnancy. Malawi is noted to be highly endemic for schistosomiasis.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, pulse was 78 bpm, and respiratory rate was 20 breath cycles per minute. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared in a fair nutritional state with mild scleral jaundice. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse tenderness without guarding. The liver was not enlarged, but the spleen was palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Chest and pelvic examinations were unremarkable, with no vaginal discharge.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, MCV of 90 fL, and platelets of 164 x 10^9/L. Creatinine was 71 µmol/L. A blood film for malaria parasites was positive with a parasite density described as 'low'. Liver function tests were not available. A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures subsequently grew Salmonella Typhi.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and enteric fever. Malaria could explain many symptoms, though the abdominal pain was noted as unusual, and low parasitemia is common in semi-immune individuals in endemic areas. Enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid) was considered due to the combination of abdominal tenderness, splenomegaly, frontal headache, and relative bradycardia. Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis were also considered possibilities.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Upon admission, the patient was started on oral artemether/lumefantrine and intravenous ceftriaxone 2g daily. After blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi, the antibiotic was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily. The patient's fever began to resolve on day 5 of antibiotic treatment, and she was discharged on day 7 to complete a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin. She was also given a single dose of praziquantel due to the high endemicity of schistosomiasis in Malawi, which can favor chronic carriage of S. Typhi.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Typhoid Fever caused by Salmonella Typhi. This was definitively confirmed by a positive blood culture. The clinical presentation of prolonged fever, abdominal pain, headache, splenomegaly, and relative bradycardia was highly consistent with enteric fever. The patient also had a concurrent malaria infection with low parasitemia, which was treated, but her sustained illness and response to ciprofloxacin pointed to typhoid as the primary diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Typhoid fever\n\n## Case 22---32-Year-Old-Woman-from-Nigeria-With-Jaund_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.764)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent who was born in Europe. Due to being born in Europe, she was considered unlikely to have any immunity to malaria.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, followed three days later by abnormal behaviour and confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed a fever 18 days after returning to Europe from a trip to Nigeria. Three days after the onset of fever, she became very unwell with abnormal behaviour and confusion. At the time of clinical presentation, she was mildly jaundiced and confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. As a person of African descent born in Europe, she is part of a group at high risk for imported malaria, often due to not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. The area of travel is known for both malaria and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa).\n**Vitals**: On examination, she had a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was mildly jaundiced and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15. She had no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and her throat and sclerae were not injected. Examination of the chest revealed some fine crepitations at the lung bases.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria blood film was positive for Plasmodium falciparum with a parasite count of 18%. Blood tests demonstrated acute kidney injury with a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L. During her hospital course, chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS. Initial laboratory testing was delayed due to concern for viral haemorrhagic fever.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was severe falciparum malaria, the most common cause of fever with jaundice or confusion in a returnee from West Africa. Other causes considered included acute viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, ascending cholangitis, advanced HIV, and Gram-negative sepsis. Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) like Lassa was considered a risk but deemed less likely due to the long incubation period (18+ days) and the absence of injected sclerae or rash.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. Her urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, and she required haemofiltration for deteriorating renal function. Despite a drop in her parasite count to 5%, she lapsed into a deep coma. After the parasites cleared on day 5, her consciousness level improved, but she developed laboured breathing and ARDS, requiring prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe falciparum malaria, confirmed by a blood film showing a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18%. The clinical syndrome of fever, confusion (cerebral malaria), jaundice, acute kidney injury, and ARDS following travel to an endemic area is characteristic of severe malaria. Her clinical course and eventual recovery after treatment with intravenous artesunate are consistent with this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Severe falciparum malaria\n\n## Case 44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.747)\n**Patient Information**: A 7-year-old girl from South Sudan, described as severely malnourished with a Z-score less than -3. She has never been admitted to a hospital before the current illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-week history of undulating fever.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient's uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative. An initial visceral leishmaniasis rK39-antibody RDT was also negative. However, a subsequent Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis was positive with a high titre (≥1:6,400).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient's positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\n**Disease Name Short**: Visceral leishmaniasis""]","Diagnosis: Ebola virus disease
Reason: The patient is a female neonate born in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a 22-year-old mother who was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease via PCR at 34 weeks of gestation. The mother recovered after one week of supportive care. The infant was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks gestation with excellent Apgar scores and a normal physical examination. Multiple diagnostic tests were performed on the newborn at birth. Umbilical cord blood PCR, peripheral blood swabs, and salivary swabs were all negative for Ebola virus. The infant was discharged home and was growing normally at a one-month follow-up appointment.","This case describes a neonate born free of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to a mother who had a confirmed infection during her third trimester. The mother's infection with Ebola virus was confirmed by PCR at 34 weeks gestation. The diagnosis of an uninfected infant was established by negative PCR tests for Ebola virus on the neonate's umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, and saliva at birth. This represents a rare, favorable outcome, as maternal EVD during pregnancy is associated with extremely high rates of fetal and neonatal mortality.",0.5112359533316043,0.07142857142857142,0.9999999999
"A 7-year-old boy in Texas presented with a two-day history of right-hand pruritus and arm pain. Over the next few days, his condition worsened to include a rash, delusions, spasms, high fever, hypersalivation, and altered mental status, requiring intubation for airway protection. An extensive initial workup for common central nervous system infections, including various viruses and bacteria, was negative. A detailed history subsequently revealed that the child had been bitten by a bat approximately two months before symptom onset. No post-exposure prophylaxis was administered at the time of the bite because there were no visible marks.","[""## Case 78---A-42-Year-Old-British-Man-Living-in-Malawi_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropi (score=0.802)\n**Patient Information**: A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months. He has a family history of allergy. He had previously kept bees and been stung frequently without ill effect, but 9 months prior to admission, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed an asthmatic attack that resolved spontaneously.\n**Chief Complaint**: Florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing, and a feeling of impending death.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported a suspected tick bite on his ankle two days before presenting. Twenty-four hours later, he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He was seen at a clinic where a malaria blood film was negative and was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a widespread itchy rash and subsequently became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient, an expatriate living in Malawi for 18 months, was walking in the countryside two days before his illness began. A more specific exposure was later identified: a visit to a national game park two weeks before his illness, where he suffered numerous painful bites from tsetse flies.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his vital signs were: temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg. On day 3, he developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39°C.\n**Physical Exam**: On initial examination, the patient was clammy, in a state of collapse, with a widespread urticarial rash, respiratory distress, and stridor. Chest auscultation revealed expiratory wheezes. A painless, indurated, circumscribed swelling was noted on the inside of his left ankle. On day 3 of admission, the urticaria, stridor, and wheezing resolved, replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash, a slightly puffy face, and a bad headache.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 17.4 d/dL, a white cell count of 6.1 G/L (85% polymorphs), and an ESR of 5 mm/hour. A blood film for malaria parasites, chest radiograph, and stool and urine microscopy were all negative. On day 3, a thick blood film revealed 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field. A lumbar puncture performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was anaphylactic shock, presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials considered were invasive helminthiasis (like acute schistosomiasis), rickettsial disease, and connective tissue disease, though the absence of eosinophilia was noted. After the clinical picture changed on day 3, with fever, headache, and a new rash, trypanosomiasis was suspected.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated for anaphylactic shock with intramuscular adrenaline, with good effect. He was admitted and received intermittent IM adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone, and oral antihistamines for two days. After the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was confirmed on day 3, he was treated with a full course of suramin, totaling 5.75g, starting with a test dose. His urine was monitored weekly during treatment and showed transient protein, casts, and white cells, which resolved after treatment finished.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis, likely caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. Although the initial presentation was an atypical anaphylactic shock, the subsequent development of fever, headache, an erythematous rash, and the recognition of a trypanosomal chancre at the bite site led to the correct diagnosis. The key epidemiological link was the exposure to tsetse fly bites in a game park two weeks prior. The infection was determined to be first-stage as the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\n**Disease Name Short**: East African Trypanosomiasis\n\n## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.783)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 52---A-56-Year-Old-Man-from-Peru-With-Prolonged-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.781)\n**Patient Information**: A 56-year-old male Peruvian with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-week history of fever, jaundice, and confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's daily fever started three months after spending three weeks in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru. In the second week of the illness, he noticed dark urine and jaundice. A few days before admission, his wife noted the onset of confusion and somnolence.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Three months prior to his illness, the patient had a three-week vacation in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru at an altitude of 2400 m. While there, he and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes and did not use any personal protection. No animal contact was reported.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2°C (102.6°F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared confused and disorientated, with a GCS of 14/15, but had no focal neurological findings or meningeal signs. His skin and conjunctivae were markedly pale, and scleral jaundice was present. The liver was slightly enlarged, but there was no splenomegaly. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results revealed severe anemia (Hemoglobin 6 g/dL) with evidence of hemolysis, including high reticulocytes (8%), elevated LDH (1500 U/L), and hyperbilirubinemia (Total 239 µmol/L, Direct 103 µmol/L). The white blood cell count was elevated at 14.9 x 10^9/L with neutrophilia, and platelets were high at 454 x 10^9/L. The Coomb's test was negative. Creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, and CSF results were all normal. A CT scan of the brain was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with no focal lesions. Blood films for malaria were negative, but a thin film showed massive red blood cell infestation by pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures compatible with *B. bacilliformis*. Blood cultures, including those on special media for Bartonella, were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses considered were malaria and bartonellosis. *Plasmodium vivax* was a possibility, given the features of severe anemia, jaundice, and impaired consciousness, but this species is not typically associated with severe malaria. Bartonellosis was a strong consideration due to the travel history to the Peruvian highlands where sandfly vectors are present. Less common considerations included rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, brucellosis, and viral hepatitis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition progressed to shock, requiring transfer to the ICU for vasopressor treatment. He was started on a 10-day course of intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. His altered mental status resolved after 3 days of antimicrobial therapy, and his fever subsided after 5 days. By day 4, the bacteria were no longer visible on blood smears. He experienced no further complications and was well at a 3-month follow-up.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is acute bartonellosis (Oroya fever) caused by infection with *Bartonella bacilliformis*. This was confirmed by the microscopic finding of massive red blood cell infestation with pleomorphic cocco-bacillary structures on a thin blood smear. The clinical syndrome of prolonged fever, severe hemolytic anemia, and neurologic compromise, along with the specific travel history to an endemic region in the Peruvian Andes, is characteristic of this disease. Malaria was appropriately ruled out by negative blood films.\n**Disease Name Short**: Bartonellosis\n\n## Case 21---A-35-Year-Old-American-Man-With-Fatigue-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.779)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Caucasian male with an unremarkable past medical history. He works as a postal worker and has had no foreign travel within the previous year or contact with animals.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fatigue and a neck lesion that started as a papule two days prior.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a rash on his neck that began as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion was non-pruritic but associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation. He reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache but no fever. He recalled a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before its onset while shaving. He had been seen in a clinic 24 hours prior and was discharged on an oral cephalosporin, but returned due to worsening malaise, neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a postal worker in the United States with no recent foreign travel, contact with animals, or known insect bites. The case occurred during an investigation into a bioterrorism event, and his exposure was later determined to be from handling contaminated mail during his occupation.\n**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His neck circumference had increased from a baseline of 57 cm to a peak of 81 cm.\n**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed a 2 cm irregularly shaped, indurated, non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion had a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There was massive neck oedema which made lymph node assessment difficult. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, were normal except for a mildly elevated hemoglobin at 18.7 g/dL. Blood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. A subsequent Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion were negative for B. anthracis. However, a skin biopsy sent to a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed the presence of B. anthracis antigens. Convalescent serology revealed the presence of antibodies to protective antigen.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for an ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. Given the ongoing bioterrorism investigation in the United States at the time, cutaneous anthrax was the most important diagnosis to consider, supported by the presence of a painless papule evolving into an ulcer with extensive, non-tender edema and systemic symptoms without significant fever.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with a first-generation cephalosporin but his condition worsened. Upon his return to the clinic, he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam. Following this treatment regimen, the patient recovered.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a skin biopsy which showed abundant B. anthracis antigens, and by serology showing antibodies to protective antigen in convalescent serum. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's clinical picture of a painless ulcer with massive edema and his occupational exposure as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a known bioterrorism event.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cutaneous anthrax""]","Diagnosis: Tropical pulmonary edema
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including the rash, delusions, spasms, high fever, hypersalivation, and altered mental status, are characteristic of tropical pulmonary edema. The patient's history of being bitten by a bat and the absence of visible marks suggest a tropical origin, which is a common cause of tropical pulmonary edema.","The diagnosis is human rabies. This is supported by the clinical presentation of acute progressive neuroencephalitis (altered mental status, seizures, hypersalivation) in a patient with a history of a bat bite two months prior, for which no post-exposure prophylaxis was given. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting rabies viral RNA via real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nuchal skin biopsy and saliva specimens. Viral sequencing was consistent with a rabies virus variant found in the Mexican free-tailed bat.",0.46346745319534227,0.0,0.0
"An 18-year-old, previously healthy, unvaccinated postpartum woman presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe dyspnea, chest pain, and respiratory distress. Her symptoms developed approximately six weeks after recovering from an acute viral illness. On arrival, she was tachycardic to 170 beats per minute, tachypneic, and severely hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on high-flow oxygen. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally. An initial chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan confirmed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, a minimal left-sided pneumothorax, and diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation. She later developed a contralateral tension pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube.","[""## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.800)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease\n\n## Case 45---A-2-Month-Old-Girl-from-Laos-With-Dyspnoea-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.799)\n**Patient Information**: A 2-month-old baby girl from Laos, born at term and previously well. Her mother is a 24-year-old rice farmer. The infant was exclusively breastfed.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 3-day history of irritability, dyspnoea, and grunting.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The infant suddenly became unwell three days prior to presentation. She developed irritability, dyspnoea, grunting, and was breastfeeding poorly. The mother reported the baby was neither feverish nor coughing, and had been perfectly well since birth.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The infant resides in Laos and is exclusively breastfed. Her mother, a rice farmer, practiced prolonged postpartum food avoidance, a common cultural practice involving a diet of mainly milled glutinous rice while avoiding beef, pork, vegetables, and fruits. The mother herself had symptoms of anorexia, weakness, a husky voice, and paresthesias, suggestive of her own thiamine deficiency.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, the temperature was 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse was 140 bpm, and respiratory rate was 40 breaths per minute. The blood pressure was not taken. The child was dyspnoeic and had central cyanosis.\n**Physical Exam**: The infant was irritable, crying, and grunting. Examination revealed signs of heart failure, including central cyanosis, hepatomegaly, and oedematous extremities. Her chest was clear on auscultation, and no heart murmurs were heard.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Blood samples were taken from both the child and the mother. Laboratory analysis confirmed that both were thiamine-deficient. No other specific lab results were reported in the case.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included congenital heart disease, respiratory diseases (e.g., bronchopneumonia), meningitis, and infantile beriberi. Respiratory disease was deemed unlikely due to the absence of cough, wheeze, fever, and a normal chest exam. Congenital heart disease was less likely given the sudden onset of symptoms well after birth and the absence of a heart murmur. Meningitis was considered improbable without fever or bulging fontanels. The combination of dyspnoea, poor feeding, abnormal cry, and signs of heart failure in an infant from an endemic area strongly suggested infantile beriberi.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The child was immediately given intravenous thiamine (50 mg). She showed a quick and dramatic response to the treatment. Six hours after administration, she was able to breastfeed normally and was subsequently discharged the following day. The mother was prescribed oral thiamine supplementation and received counseling to consume a well-balanced, thiamine-rich diet.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is infantile beriberi, which is a clinical thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of acute heart failure in an exclusively breastfed infant from an endemic region, and it was confirmed by the rapid and dramatic response to intravenous thiamine. Subsequent biochemical analysis verified that both the mother and child were thiamine-deficient, a result of the mother's restricted postpartum diet.\n**Disease Name Short**: Infantile beriberi\n\n## Case 89---A-30-Year-Old-Woman-from-Bolivia-With-Ex_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.799)\n**Patient Information**: A 30-year-old woman, born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with no relevant past medical history and taking no medications. She presented to a clinic in Spain 4 months after arriving in Europe and expressed a wish to become pregnant.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-year history of progressive dyspnoea on moderate exertion and self-limiting palpitations.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported a two-year history of progressive dyspnoea at moderate exertion (New York Heart Association grade II) accompanied by self-limiting palpitations. The presentation was notable for the absence of clinical signs of heart failure.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient was born in Bolivia and grew up in a rural area during her childhood, a known risk factor for Chagas disease. She had been living in an urban environment for the past 20 years and had arrived in Europe 4 months prior to her presentation. Her origin from a highly endemic country prompted screening for Chagas disease.\n**Vitals**: On examination, her blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg, her pulse was regular at 40 beats per minute, and her SpO2 was 99% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination was unremarkable. Cardiac auscultation revealed clear sounds with no murmurs, the chest was clear, and there was no peripheral oedema or raised jugular venous pressure.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count and basic blood chemistry were normal. Serological testing for Chagas disease was positive on two different assays detecting IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi. An ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a right bundle branch block. A chest radiograph demonstrated a moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiomegaly). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophic left ventricle without obstruction.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: For a recent migrant from Bolivia, the initial differential screening panel included active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and strongyloidiasis. However, Chagas disease was the primary consideration due to the patient's specific origin, the high prevalence in that region, and the clinical findings of bradycardia and conduction abnormalities, which are characteristic of chagasic cardiomyopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was diagnosed with chagasic cardiomyopathy and started on antitrypanosomal therapy with benznidazole (5 mg/kg per day) for 60 days, given her intent to become pregnant. Fifteen days into the course, she developed a pruritic maculopapular rash and mild eosinophilia, which resolved after temporary discontinuation of benznidazole and a 5-day course of corticosteroids and antihistamines. Benznidazole was successfully re-introduced, and she completed the full 60-day treatment. At a 5-year follow-up, her cardiac function was stable, and she had given birth to a healthy child.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is chronic Chagas disease with chagasic cardiomyopathy, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Confirmation was based on positive results from two different serological tests for IgG antibodies. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's epidemiological history of growing up in a rural endemic area (Bolivia) and clinical evidence of cardiac involvement, including sinus bradycardia, right bundle branch block on ECG, cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, and a hypertrophic left ventricle on echocardiogram.\n**Disease Name Short**: Chagas disease\n\n## Case 55---A-40-Year-Old-Male-Farmer-from-Peru-With-Ch_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.793)\n**Patient Information**: A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously, and a recent HIV ELISA test was negative. The patient denies recent travels.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, and significant weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized for similar complaints, at which time three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was made based on clinical and radiographic findings, and he was started on first-line TB therapy. Despite adherence, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistent cough that developed streaking of blood, leading to a referral for suspected multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB).\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a farmer from a rural area in the Peruvian Amazon. His occupation and geographic origin are relevant for endemic fungal infections. He denies recent travels.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg, pulse was 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared fatigued and cachectic. Examination revealed a few small, mobile, soft, non-tender cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes. Auscultation of the lungs found bilateral crackles and rhonchi. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed significant thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 1093 × 10^9/L; the rest of the full blood count was normal. Two repeated AFB smears and a tuberculin skin test were negative. A chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates, predominantly in the central and upper zones, with multiple cavities in the right lung and no hilar lymphadenopathy. Examination of a sputum potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed the characteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and the organism was subsequently grown in culture.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses considered were MDR TB, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. TB is highly endemic in Peru, making it a necessary consideration. Histoplasmosis can mimic TB symptoms. However, paracoccidioidomycosis was deemed most likely given the patient's age, gender, occupation (farmer), geographic origin (Peruvian Amazon), and clinical presentation, which are all typical for the chronic form of this mycosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Initial treatment with first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was ineffective. After the definitive diagnosis was made, TB treatment was discontinued. Due to the extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole. The thrombocytosis was considered a reactive process to the chronic infection.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. It was confirmed by the visualization of characteristic yeast forms on a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, with subsequent isolation in fungal culture. The clinical picture, including the failure to respond to empiric TB therapy and the patient's specific demographic and exposure profile as a farmer from the Peruvian Amazon, strongly supported this diagnosis over tuberculosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Paracoccidioidomycosis""]","Diagnosis: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Reason: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with ARDS, which is characterized by acute lung injury and failure. The patient's age, primary symptoms, and the presence of a tension pneumothorax are also consistent with ARDS.","The final diagnosis is a severe pulmonary complication of measles. This is supported by the patient's history of a recent measles infection, her unvaccinated status, and the development of acute respiratory failure approximately six weeks later during the convalescent phase. The specific life-threatening complications were bilateral, sequential tension pneumothorax and diffuse lung injury. The diagnosis of the pneumothoraces and parenchymal lung disease was confirmed by chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans.",0.21439408855216682,0.2,0.0

No relevant comorbidities, immunosuppression, or allergies are mentioned.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of high-grade fever, chills, body aches, cough, and shortness of breath, complicated by recent onset of tinnitus, hearing loss, and increasing confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day illness characterized by high-grade fever, chills, body aches, non-productive cough, and progressive shortness of breath. Two days before admission, she developed tinnitus and hearing loss. In the 24 hours prior to admission, she became increasingly confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural area of Sri Lanka, an endemic region for scrub typhus. A crater-like lesion (eschar) was later found in her right axilla, consistent with the bite of an infected trombiculid mite (chigger), the vector for Orientia tsutsugamushi.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient's temperature was 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate was 120 bpm, and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was confused with severely impaired hearing (WHO grade 3). There were enlarged axillary lymph nodes on the right side. Lungs had scattered crackles at the bases. The liver was enlarged to 5 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen was just palpable. No rash or neck stiffness was present. A later examination on day 2 revealed a well-demarcated, crater-like eschar hidden in the right axilla.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed a normal WBC, mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98 x 10^9/L), elevated AST (74 U/L) and ALT (68 U/L), and elevated creatinine (123.8 µmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (35 cells/µL, 80% lymphocytes) with elevated protein (0.64 g/L). Blood cultures, Leptospira and Salmonella serologies, and a thick film for malaria were all negative. A chest radiograph and brain CT scan were normal, while an EEG showed widespread slowing. The diagnosis was supported by a high Orientia tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre of >1:4096.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this undifferentiated febrile illness included scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, and malaria. The clinical triad of fever, deafness, and confusion in a patient from this region strongly suggested scrub typhus. Malaria was excluded by a negative thick film, while serologies for Leptospira and Salmonella were also negative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: On the second day of admission, the patient's neurological status deteriorated with worsening confusion (GCS 8) and development of coarse tremors and saccadic eye oscillations. After an eschar was found, doxycycline therapy was commenced. The patient improved significantly within 48 hours and was discharged on day 6. Her hearing returned to normal, and she had no residual neurological deficits.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is scrub typhus, caused by infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation (fever, confusion, deafness), epidemiological risk (rural Sri Lanka), key physical finding of an eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confirmation with a high specific IFA-IgG antibody titre (>1:4096). Alternative diagnoses were ruled out by negative laboratory testing.\n**Disease Name Short**: Scrub typhus\n\n## Case 93---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Logger-from-Peru-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.817)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Peruvian man, born in Lima, with a past medical history of hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years prior. He has not received any vaccinations since early childhood and has not taken any malaria prophylaxis.\n**Chief Complaint**: Referred from a local hospital for fever, jaundice, bleeding, and altered mental status, eight days after symptom onset.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever and retro-orbital headache eight days before referral. Two days into the illness, his condition worsened with the onset of jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria, and increasing mental obtundation, leading to admission at a local jungle hospital. During his transfer to the referral hospital in Lima, he experienced a generalized seizure.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: For the past five years, the patient has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River, which forms the Amazon River. This occupation in an endemic region of Peru exposed him to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. He was unvaccinated against relevant regional diseases.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands, and intermittently stuporous with marked flapping of hands (asterixis). He was jaundiced, with spontaneous bleeding from his oral mucosa and at IV sites, and had multiple large ecchymoses on his face, trunk, and limbs. Lung auscultation revealed crepitant rales in both bases. The liver was enlarged and felt 3 cm below the right costal margin, but the spleen was not palpable and there was no lymphadenopathy. There were no focal neurological or meningeal signs.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed anaemia (haematocrit 30%), mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 110,000/μL), and a normal white cell count. There was severe hepatocellular injury with AST 2890 U/L and ALT 2676 U/L, cholestasis with total bilirubin 11.6 mg/dL, and coagulopathy with an INR of 2.6 and aPTT of 80s. Acute kidney injury was present (Urea 89 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 50-60 RBCs/field. Malaria thick films (x3), blood cultures, Brucella serology, and Hepatitis B IgM anti-HBc were all negative. IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever was highly positive (1:10000), while anti-dengue IgM was negative. A chest x-ray later showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Subsequent labs showed worsening renal failure and a sudden drop in liver transaminases.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for this acute febrile illness with liver failure included severe malaria, though transaminases were atypically high. Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and toxic hepatitis were considered. Leptospirosis was less likely due to the extreme elevation of transaminases. Typhoid and brucellosis were also possibilities. Severe dengue was considered, but the prolonged fever, prominent jaundice, and low haematocrit made it less probable. Given his occupation and lack of vaccination in an endemic area, yellow fever was a primary concern among other viral haemorrhagic fevers.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received supportive care along with presumptive treatment for malaria and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite this, his condition rapidly deteriorated over the next three days with worsening hepatic encephalopathy, progressive renal failure, coma, and DIC with increased spontaneous bleeding. He developed ARDS. Laboratory results showed worsening kidney function and a sudden drop in liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatic disintegration. The patient passed away one day later, on the fourth day of admission to the Lima hospital.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe, fatal yellow fever. This was confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever with a titer of 1:10000. The clinical presentation of fever, jaundice, bleeding, and multi-organ failure (liver, kidney, lungs) in an unvaccinated logger working in an endemic region of the Peruvian Amazon is classic for the disease. Other considerations like malaria, dengue, and bacterial sepsis were less likely given the clinical picture and negative diagnostic tests. The terminal drop in transaminases was consistent with near-total destruction of hepatocytes.\n**Disease Name Short**: Yellow fever\n\n## Case 4---A-4-Year-Old-Girl-from-Uganda-in-a-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical-Medi (score=0.814)\n**Patient Information**: A 4-year-old girl from Uganda, described as previously healthy, with no report of recent head trauma or other known reasons for illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: Unconsciousness following a seizure.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until the day prior to presentation, when she developed a bad headache in the afternoon, followed by shaking chills in the evening. She slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. on the day of presentation, she was found having a seizure that lasted about ten minutes. She did not awaken afterwards, and it took her family four hours to bring her to the Accident and Emergency Department.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural eastern Uganda during the rainy season. Malaria is a common problem in her village, and the family initially suspected her illness was another episode of malaria, indicating residence in a high-transmission area.\n**Vitals**: On admission, her temperature was 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse was 150 bpm, respiratory rate was 36 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 98/40 mmHg. A rapid test for glucose was normal.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was deeply comatose with a Blantyre Coma Scale of 1/5. She had nasal flaring, a gallop rhythm on cardiac exam, and hepatosplenomegaly, with the liver palpable 2 cm and the spleen 4 cm below the costal margins. Neurologically, she had no neck stiffness, pupils were 2 mm and reactive, and extraocular movements were normal by oculocephalic manoeuvres. With stimulation, she exhibited decerebrate posturing that resolved spontaneously. Initial direct ophthalmoscopy showed no papilloedema, but a later examination after mydriatic drops revealed white-centred haemorrhages in both eyes.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results on admission revealed a haematocrit of 17.6% (indicating anaemia) and a platelet count of 28 x 10^9/L (thrombocytopenia). The Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) was positive. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and acellular with a normal opening pressure. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Blood cultures were taken.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for coma included cerebral malaria, acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, and intoxication. Metabolic abnormalities like hypoglycaemia and non-convulsive status epilepticus were also considered. Hypoglycaemia was ruled out by a normal rapid glucose test, and a post-ictal state was considered unlikely as four hours had passed since the seizure. Although neck stiffness was absent, this was considered an unreliable sign in deep coma, so meningitis could not be initially excluded. The positive malaria RDT was noted as potentially non-specific due to high rates of asymptomatic parasitaemia in the region.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was started on intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg, which was repeated at 12 and 24 hours, and then continued once daily. She was admitted to a high-dependency unit for monitoring. Twelve hours after admission, she experienced a single, brief, self-resolving generalized seizure. Her level of consciousness improved, with her Blantyre Coma Score rising to 4/5 by 40 hours after admission. She was discharged home on hospital day five with a scheduled neurology follow-up.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria. This diagnosis was made based on the presence of an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with a positive malaria RDT, consistent with the WHO definition. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the ophthalmoscopic finding of white-centred haemorrhages, a key feature of malarial retinopathy, which is highly specific for cerebral malaria and helps distinguish it from coma with incidental parasitaemia. Alternative diagnoses like bacterial meningitis were excluded by the normal CSF findings.\n**Disease Name Short**: Cerebral malaria\n\n## Case 27---A-16-Year-Old-Boy-from-Sri-Lanka-With-Fever_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.806)\n**Patient Information**: A 16-year-old Sri Lankan boy who was attending school until the onset of his illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches for 2 days, with anuria for the preceding 12 hours.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented to a local hospital with a 2-day history of fever, frontal headache, and severe body aches. During this illness, he had vomited two to three times and had not passed any urine for the 12 hours prior to presentation. He reported no cough, coryza, or shortness of breath.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in Sri Lanka. Five days before falling ill, he had been fishing in an urban water stream.\n**Vitals**: On clinical examination, his temperature was 38.3°C (100.9°F), the pulse rate was 100 bpm (low in volume), and his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The boy appeared ill, drowsy, jaundiced, and had subconjunctival haemorrhages. There was severe muscle tenderness, mainly involving the abdominal wall and calves, making it difficult for him to walk. The liver was palpable 4cm below the right costal margin and was tender. Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness was present. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Examination of the heart and lungs was normal, and the neurological examination was also normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia (platelets 96 ×10⁹/L) and acute renal failure (blood urea nitrogen 20.7 µmol/L, serum creatinine 212.2 µmol/L). Liver function tests showed cholestatic jaundice with a total bilirubin of 77 µmol/L and direct bilirubin of 54.7 µmol/L, along with mildly elevated AST (64 IU/L) and ALT (58 IU/L). C-reactive protein was elevated at 48 mg/L. The white blood cell count was normal at 5.7 ×10⁹/L. Urine microscopy showed 20 red blood cells per high-power field, protein '+', and granular casts '+'. A chest radiograph was normal and an ECG showed sinus tachycardia.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was leptospirosis, given the presentation of acute febrile illness with jaundice, renal failure, and a history of exposure to potentially contaminated water. Other diagnoses considered included scrub typhus, which can present similarly but often involves an eschar and lymphadenopathy; hantavirus infection, due to its similar epidemiology; and dengue haemorrhagic fever, in which acute kidney injury and jaundice are uncommon.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Severe leptospirosis was suspected, and the patient was started on empirical benzylpenicillin. Despite rehydration, he developed acute renal failure requiring haemodialysis (HD). His hospital course was complicated by myocarditis and atrial fibrillation, but he tolerated further HD sessions. The patient gradually recovered over 10 days with intensive care management.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe leptospirosis, presenting as Weil's syndrome. This is strongly supported by the clinical triad of fever, cholestatic jaundice, and acute renal failure, along with findings of subconjunctival haemorrhage, severe myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is further corroborated by the clear epidemiological link of fishing in an urban stream five days prior to symptom onset. Although specific diagnostic tests were not detailed, the clinical suspicion was high, and the patient's recovery following empirical antibiotic therapy and intensive supportive care, including dialysis, aligns with this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Leptospirosis""]","Diagnosis: Dengue haemorrhagic fever
Reason: The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with dengue haemorrhagic fever, including the onset of fever, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, left-sided hemiparesis, and meningoencephalitis on MRI. The severe thrombocytopenia and elevated liver transaminases are also characteristic of dengue. The patient's age and primary symptoms are also consistent with dengue.","The final diagnosis is dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated by parainfectious dengue encephalitis. This is supported by the patient's presentation with an acute febrile illness and neurological signs in a dengue-endemic region. The development of severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, markedly elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of plasma leakage (rising hematocrit, free fluid on ultrasound) confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis of dengue encephalitis was established by a positive serum dengue NS1 antigen test and positive serum dengue IgM, combined with MRI findings of encephalitis and the later detection of dengue IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid, after excluding other common causes of viral encephalitis.",0.5527646871730623,0.14285714285714285,0.0
"A 47-year-old Belgian woman, who was not vaccinated, developed an acute illness during a one-week vacation in The Gambia. Her symptoms began with high fever, chills, headache, back pain, and severe asthenia. Upon returning to Europe, she was admitted to an intensive care unit with jaundice, anuria, and profound weakness. Laboratory evaluation revealed thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, acute kidney injury, and extremely elevated liver transaminases (AST 49,000 U/L, ALT 23,000 U/L). She subsequently developed a severe coagulopathy with an elevated INR, leading to bleeding from injection sites and massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which resulted in hypovolemic shock and death.","[""## Case 22---32-Year-Old-Woman-from-Nigeria-With-Jaund_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.833)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent who was born in Europe. Due to being born in Europe, she was considered unlikely to have any immunity to malaria.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, followed three days later by abnormal behaviour and confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed a fever 18 days after returning to Europe from a trip to Nigeria. Three days after the onset of fever, she became very unwell with abnormal behaviour and confusion. At the time of clinical presentation, she was mildly jaundiced and confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. As a person of African descent born in Europe, she is part of a group at high risk for imported malaria, often due to not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. The area of travel is known for both malaria and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa).\n**Vitals**: On examination, she had a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was mildly jaundiced and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15. She had no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and her throat and sclerae were not injected. Examination of the chest revealed some fine crepitations at the lung bases.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria blood film was positive for Plasmodium falciparum with a parasite count of 18%. Blood tests demonstrated acute kidney injury with a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L. During her hospital course, chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS. Initial laboratory testing was delayed due to concern for viral haemorrhagic fever.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was severe falciparum malaria, the most common cause of fever with jaundice or confusion in a returnee from West Africa. Other causes considered included acute viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, ascending cholangitis, advanced HIV, and Gram-negative sepsis. Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) like Lassa was considered a risk but deemed less likely due to the long incubation period (18+ days) and the absence of injected sclerae or rash.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. Her urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, and she required haemofiltration for deteriorating renal function. Despite a drop in her parasite count to 5%, she lapsed into a deep coma. After the parasites cleared on day 5, her consciousness level improved, but she developed laboured breathing and ARDS, requiring prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe falciparum malaria, confirmed by a blood film showing a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18%. The clinical syndrome of fever, confusion (cerebral malaria), jaundice, acute kidney injury, and ARDS following travel to an endemic area is characteristic of severe malaria. Her clinical course and eventual recovery after treatment with intravenous artesunate are consistent with this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Severe falciparum malaria\n\n## Case 85---A-55-Year-Old-Female-Pig-Farmer-from-Vietnam-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.832)\n**Patient Information**: A 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, for which she has been on treatment for 4 years. She is a pig farmer and works as a butcher in a local market, selling pork and chicken.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 1-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting, followed by impaired consciousness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented to a hospital in rural Vietnam with a one-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. An initial blood film for malaria was negative. On the second day of her illness, she developed confusion and was subsequently referred to a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City for further investigation and management.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in rural Vietnam. She has direct occupational exposure to pigs and pork, as she raises pigs on her smallholding and works as a butcher in a local market.\n**Vitals**: On admission to the referral hospital, she had a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F), tachycardia at 124 bpm, hypotension of 85/60 mmHg, and tachypnoea at 32 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 86% on ambient air, and her Glasgow Coma Score was 12/15 (E3 M5 V4).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was confused with neck stiffness and photophobia, but had no focal neurological signs. Skin examination revealed a diffuse petechial rash over her trunk and marked purpuric non-blanching lesions on her left leg. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial labs on admission showed leukocytosis (10.25 x 10^9/L) with 86.5% neutrophils, severe thrombocytopenia (56 x 10^9/L), hyperglycemia (15.4 mmol/L), and a high lactate (11.2 mmol/L). A non-contrast brain CT, chest x-ray, and ECG were unremarkable aside from sinus tachycardia. Lumbar puncture revealed turbid cerebrospinal fluid with 2870 cells/µL (92% neutrophils), elevated protein (541.16 mg/dL), and a very low CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.12. The CSF Gram stain showed a Gram-positive coccus in short chains. Repeat malaria films, RDTs, India ink, mycobacterial GeneXpert, and Herpes simplex virus PCR were all negative. Five days later, both blood and CSF cultures grew Streptococcus suis, which was sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included severe malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and acute bacterial meningitis. Malaria was considered due to the endemic location but ruled out by negative tests. The rapid progression made enteric fever less likely. The presentation with shock and meningitis signs was not typical for dengue. The most probable diagnosis was acute bacterial meningitis with septic shock. Given the Vietnamese setting and the patient's exposure to pigs, Streptococcus suis was the most likely causative agent, over more globally common pathogens like S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received initial treatment with fluids and paracetamol. At the referral hospital, she was started on empirical intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin, along with supportive care. Dexamethasone was administered for the first 4 days of treatment. She completed a 12-day course of antibiotics. The patient responded to treatment but suffered a complication of residual bilateral hearing impairment.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis complicated by septic shock. This was confirmed by the isolation of S. suis from both blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The clinical presentation of acute meningitis, shock, and a purpuric rash, along with the patient's clear occupational exposure to pigs, was highly suggestive. The diagnosis was further supported by classic CSF findings of bacterial meningitis, including a high neutrophil count and a very low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio.\n**Disease Name Short**: Streptococcus suis meningitis\n\n## Case 39---A-30-Year-Old-Male-Chinese-Trader-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.830)\n**Patient Information**: A 30-year-old male Chinese itinerant trader with no other reported comorbidities.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 7-day history of fever, chills, headache and a dry cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed slide-positive falciparum malaria while living in southern Laos and self-treated with intravenous and intramuscular artemether 80 mg for 5 days, using medication he brought from China. He did not improve; the fever persisted, he developed jaundice, and was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Vientiane for further management.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient was an itinerant trader living in southern Laos, a region endemic for falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant strains, as well as other infections like scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis. His exposure was to a substandard antimalarial drug he had brought from China.\n**Vitals**: On admission to the hospital in Vientiane, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F). His blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score were reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Clinical findings on admission included nausea, dry cough, moderate dehydration, chest pain, and abdominal tenderness. His chest was clear on auscultation, and no hepatosplenomegaly was detected.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: On admission, a Giemsa smear was negative for malaria parasites, but a rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2) was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Serum creatinine and glucose were normal. Liver function tests were elevated with an ALT of 301 U/L, AST of 230 U/L, and ALP of 470 U/L. Total bilirubin was 14 µmol/L and direct bilirubin was 6.4 µmol/L. Subsequent analysis of the artemether he had used showed it was substandard, containing only 59 mg, which was 74% of the stated dose.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnoses considered for the persistent fever included bacterial co-infection (especially Salmonella), another common infectious disease from Laos (such as scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, or dengue fever), or failure of malaria treatment. Potential causes for treatment failure included artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, incorrect dosing, or the use of a poor-quality antimalarial drug.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After failing to improve on a 5-day course of self-administered artemether, the patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate 10 mg/kg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for a duration of 7 days. His fever resolved 35 hours after starting this new therapy, and he was discharged well. Investigations found no evidence of any other infections.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was treatment failure of falciparum malaria due to the use of a substandard medication. The initial malaria infection was confirmed by a positive HRP-2 test, despite a negative smear post-treatment. The failure to respond to the initial 5-day course of artemether was determined to be caused by the poor quality of the drug, which chemical analysis revealed was significantly underdosed (74% of stated content). The patient's rapid clinical resolution with a standard course of quality-assured quinine and doxycycline supported this conclusion over drug resistance or a co-infection.\n**Disease Name Short**: Falciparum malaria\n\n## Case 93---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Logger-from-Peru-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.824)\n**Patient Information**: A 35-year-old Peruvian man, born in Lima, with a past medical history of hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years prior.

Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with severe falciparum malaria, including the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the blood, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver transaminases. The patient's travel history and the presence of malaria parasites in her blood suggest that she was exposed to malaria during her vacation in The Gambia. The patient's clinical course and the presence of severe coagulopathy with bleeding and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are also consistent with severe falciparum malaria.","The diagnosis is Yellow Fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the yellow fever virus. This is strongly supported by the patient's travel to an endemic area (The Gambia) without prior vaccination. Her clinical course was classic, featuring an acute febrile phase followed by a toxic phase with jaundice, renal failure, extremely high liver enzymes, and a severe coagulopathy leading to fatal hemorrhage. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for yellow fever virus on a plasma sample.",0.22028718817241955,0.75,0.0
"A 36-year-old female nurse in Nigeria presented with a three-day history of high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, and vomiting. She had not improved after treatment with antimalarials and ciprofloxacin. On admission, she was febrile, toxic-appearing, dehydrated, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Her condition worsened over the next day with a fever spike to 40.0°C, restlessness, facial puffiness, and respiratory distress with basal lung crepitations. A bedside whole blood clotting time was markedly prolonged at over 20 minutes, although no overt bleeding was observed. Initial laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count and negative blood and urine cultures.","[""## Case 74---A-28-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sierra-Leone-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.858)\n**Patient Information**: A 28-year-old woman from eastern Sierra Leone with no prior medical history reported.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain, along with loose stools for the past 2 days. She was seen at a local health post the day prior and received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin but continued to worsen. On arrival at the hospital, her exam was notable only for mild pharyngitis. Despite treatment with IV ceftriaxone and completing the antimalarial course, her condition deteriorated. Two days after admission, she developed conjunctivitis, cough, and breathlessness, becoming very unwell and unable to walk unaided.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient presented to a small rural hospital in eastern Sierra Leone. This region is noted to have a high incidence of Lassa fever, which accounts for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some local studies. Lassa fever is a zoonosis transmitted through contact with infected rat urine.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her axillary temperature was 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure was 80/55 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 100 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Initial examination was unremarkable except for mild pharyngitis. As her illness progressed, she developed conjunctivitis and bilateral fine crepitations on chest auscultation.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Her initial malaria slide was negative. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood chemistry showed mild renal impairment and raised transaminases, with an aspartate transaminase (AST/GOT) of 514 U/L (normal <50 U/L). The diagnosis of Lassa fever was later confirmed with antigen testing.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis included several possibilities. Adenovirus and measles can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, but adenovirus is typically mild and a rash would be expected with measles. Mycoplasma and other pneumonias do not typically cause conjunctivitis. Leptospirosis can present with non-specific fever and pulmonary involvement but usually causes conjunctival suffusion rather than conjunctivitis. Typhoid was considered, but improvement would be expected on ceftriaxone, and pharyngitis/conjunctivitis are not typical features. Lassa fever was considered highly likely given the patient's signs, symptoms, and location in an endemic area.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin without improvement. At the hospital, she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and completed her antimalarial course, but continued to deteriorate. After Lassa fever was confirmed by antigen testing, she was moved to a specialist isolation unit and received IV ribavirin. Strict infection control measures were implemented. Unfortunately, she was already very unwell and died 2 days later. Public health follow-up was initiated for all family, friends, and medical staff contacts.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was Lassa fever, a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by an arenavirus. This was confirmed by a positive antigen test. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical presentation of a severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, renal impairment, and elevated liver transaminases, which was refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials. The patient's presence in eastern Sierra Leone, a highly endemic area, provided strong epidemiological evidence. The patient succumbed to the illness despite late initiation of IV ribavirin.\n**Disease Name Short**: Lassa fever\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.839)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease\n\n## Case 20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.832)\n**Patient Information**: A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation. He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 22---32-Year-Old-Woman-from-Nigeria-With-Jaund_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.828)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent who was born in Europe. Due to being born in Europe, she was considered unlikely to have any immunity to malaria.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever, followed three days later by abnormal behaviour and confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed a fever 18 days after returning to Europe from a trip to Nigeria. Three days after the onset of fever, she became very unwell with abnormal behaviour and confusion. At the time of clinical presentation, she was mildly jaundiced and confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. As a person of African descent born in Europe, she is part of a group at high risk for imported malaria, often due to not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. The area of travel is known for both malaria and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa).\n**Vitals**: On examination, she had a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was mildly jaundiced and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15. She had no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and her throat and sclerae were not injected. Examination of the chest revealed some fine crepitations at the lung bases.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria blood film was positive for Plasmodium falciparum with a parasite count of 18%. Blood tests demonstrated acute kidney injury with a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L. During her hospital course, chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS. Initial laboratory testing was delayed due to concern for viral haemorrhagic fever.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was severe falciparum malaria, the most common cause of fever with jaundice or confusion in a returnee from West Africa. Other causes considered included acute viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, ascending cholangitis, advanced HIV, and Gram-negative sepsis. Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) like Lassa was considered a risk but deemed less likely due to the long incubation period (18+ days) and the absence of injected sclerae or rash.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. Her urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, and she required haemofiltration for deteriorating renal function. Despite a drop in her parasite count to 5%, she lapsed into a deep coma. After the parasites cleared on day 5, her consciousness level improved, but she developed laboured breathing and ARDS, requiring prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe falciparum malaria, confirmed by a blood film showing a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18%. The clinical syndrome of fever, confusion (cerebral malaria), jaundice, acute kidney injury, and ARDS following travel to an endemic area is characteristic of severe malaria. Her clinical course and eventual recovery after treatment with intravenous artesunate are consistent with this diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Severe falciparum malaria""]","Diagnosis: Severe malaria
Reason: The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with severe malaria, including high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, vomiting, and respiratory distress with basal lung crepitations. The prolonged whole blood clotting time is also characteristic of severe malaria.

He has not received any vaccinations since early childhood and has not taken any malaria prophylaxis.\n**Chief Complaint**: Referred from a local hospital for fever, jaundice, bleeding, and altered mental status, eight days after symptom onset.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever and retro-orbital headache eight days before referral. Two days into the illness, his condition worsened with the onset of jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria, and increasing mental obtundation, leading to admission at a local jungle hospital. During his transfer to the referral hospital in Lima, he experienced a generalized seizure.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: For the past five years, the patient has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River, which forms the Amazon River. This occupation in an endemic region of Peru exposed him to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. He was unvaccinated against relevant regional diseases.\n**Vitals**: On admission, his temperature was 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands, and intermittently stuporous with marked flapping of hands (asterixis). He was jaundiced, with spontaneous bleeding from his oral mucosa and at IV sites, and had multiple large ecchymoses on his face, trunk, and limbs. Lung auscultation revealed crepitant rales in both bases. The liver was enlarged and felt 3 cm below the right costal margin, but the spleen was not palpable and there was no lymphadenopathy. There were no focal neurological or meningeal signs.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed anaemia (haematocrit 30%), mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 110,000/μL), and a normal white cell count. There was severe hepatocellular injury with AST 2890 U/L and ALT 2676 U/L, cholestasis with total bilirubin 11.6 mg/dL, and coagulopathy with an INR of 2.6 and aPTT of 80s. Acute kidney injury was present (Urea 89 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 50-60 RBCs/field. Malaria thick films (x3), blood cultures, Brucella serology, and Hepatitis B IgM anti-HBc were all negative. IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever was highly positive (1:10000), while anti-dengue IgM was negative. A chest x-ray later showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Subsequent labs showed worsening renal failure and a sudden drop in liver transaminases.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis for this acute febrile illness with liver failure included severe malaria, though transaminases were atypically high. Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and toxic hepatitis were considered. Leptospirosis was less likely due to the extreme elevation of transaminases. Typhoid and brucellosis were also possibilities. Severe dengue was considered, but the prolonged fever, prominent jaundice, and low haematocrit made it less probable. Given his occupation and lack of vaccination in an endemic area, yellow fever was a primary concern among other viral haemorrhagic fevers.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient received supportive care along with presumptive treatment for malaria and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite this, his condition rapidly deteriorated over the next three days with worsening hepatic encephalopathy, progressive renal failure, coma, and DIC with increased spontaneous bleeding. He developed ARDS. Laboratory results showed worsening kidney function and a sudden drop in liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatic disintegration. The patient passed away one day later, on the fourth day of admission to the Lima hospital.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is severe, fatal yellow fever. This was confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever with a titer of 1:10000. The clinical presentation of fever, jaundice, bleeding, and multi-organ failure (liver, kidney, lungs) in an unvaccinated logger working in an endemic region of the Peruvian Amazon is classic for the disease. Other considerations like malaria, dengue, and bacterial sepsis were less likely given the clinical picture and negative diagnostic tests. The terminal drop in transaminases was consistent with near-total destruction of hepatocytes.\n**Disease Name Short**: Yellow fever\n\n## Case 70---A-58-Year-Old-Woman-from-Sri-Lanka-With-Fev_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop (score=0.814)\n**Patient Information**: A 58-year-old woman from a rural area in Sri Lanka. No relevant comorbidities, immunosuppression, or allergies are mentioned.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 10-day history of high-grade fever, chills, body aches, cough, and shortness of breath, complicated by recent onset of tinnitus, hearing loss, and increasing confusion.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 10-day illness characterized by high-grade fever, chills, body aches, non-productive cough, and progressive shortness of breath. Two days before admission, she developed tinnitus and hearing loss. In the 24 hours prior to admission, she became increasingly confused.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural area of Sri Lanka, an endemic region for scrub typhus. A crater-like lesion (eschar) was later found in her right axilla, consistent with the bite of an infected trombiculid mite (chigger), the vector for Orientia tsutsugamushi.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient's temperature was 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate was 120 bpm, and blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13/15.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was confused with severely impaired hearing (WHO grade 3). There were enlarged axillary lymph nodes on the right side. Lungs had scattered crackles at the bases. The liver was enlarged to 5 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen was just palpable. No rash or neck stiffness was present. A later examination on day 2 revealed a well-demarcated, crater-like eschar hidden in the right axilla.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed a normal WBC, mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98 x 10^9/L), elevated AST (74 U/L) and ALT (68 U/L), and elevated creatinine (123.8 µmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (35 cells/µL, 80% lymphocytes) with elevated protein (0.64 g/L). Blood cultures, Leptospira and Salmonella serologies, and a thick film for malaria were all negative. A chest radiograph and brain CT scan were normal, while an EEG showed widespread slowing. The diagnosis was supported by a high Orientia tsutsugamushi IFA-IgG titre of >1:4096.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this undifferentiated febrile illness included scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, and malaria. The clinical triad of fever, deafness, and confusion in a patient from this region strongly suggested scrub typhus. Malaria was excluded by a negative thick film, while serologies for Leptospira and Salmonella were also negative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: On the second day of admission, the patient's neurological status deteriorated with worsening confusion (GCS 8) and development of coarse tremors and saccadic eye oscillations. After an eschar was found, doxycycline therapy was commenced. The patient improved significantly within 48 hours and was discharged on day 6. Her hearing returned to normal, and she had no residual neurological deficits.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is scrub typhus, caused by infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation (fever, confusion, deafness), epidemiological risk (rural Sri Lanka), key physical finding of an eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confirmation with a high specific IFA-IgG antibody titre (>1:4096). Alternative diagnoses were ruled out by negative laboratory testing.\n**Disease Name Short**: Scrub typhus\n\n## Case 39---A-30-Year-Old-Male-Chinese-Trader-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.802)\n**Patient Information**: A 30-year-old male Chinese itinerant trader with no other reported comorbidities.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 7-day history of fever, chills, headache and a dry cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed slide-positive falciparum malaria while living in southern Laos and self-treated with intravenous and intramuscular artemether 80 mg for 5 days, using medication he brought from China. He did not improve; the fever persisted, he developed jaundice, and was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Vientiane for further management.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient was an itinerant trader living in southern Laos, a region endemic for falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant strains, as well as other infections like scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis. His exposure was to a substandard antimalarial drug he had brought from China.\n**Vitals**: On admission to the hospital in Vientiane, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F). His blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score were reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Clinical findings on admission included nausea, dry cough, moderate dehydration, chest pain, and abdominal tenderness. His chest was clear on auscultation, and no hepatosplenomegaly was detected.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: On admission, a Giemsa smear was negative for malaria parasites, but a rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2) was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Serum creatinine and glucose were normal. Liver function tests were elevated with an ALT of 301 U/L, AST of 230 U/L, and ALP of 470 U/L. Total bilirubin was 14 µmol/L and direct bilirubin was 6.4 µmol/L. Subsequent analysis of the artemether he had used showed it was substandard, containing only 59 mg, which was 74% of the stated dose.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnoses considered for the persistent fever included bacterial co-infection (especially Salmonella), another common infectious disease from Laos (such as scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, or dengue fever), or failure of malaria treatment. Potential causes for treatment failure included artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, incorrect dosing, or the use of a poor-quality antimalarial drug.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After failing to improve on a 5-day course of self-administered artemether, the patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate 10 mg/kg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for a duration of 7 days. His fever resolved 35 hours after starting this new therapy, and he was discharged well. Investigations found no evidence of any other infections.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was treatment failure of falciparum malaria due to the use of a substandard medication. The initial malaria infection was confirmed by a positive HRP-2 test, despite a negative smear post-treatment. The failure to respond to the initial 5-day course of artemether was determined to be caused by the poor quality of the drug, which chemical analysis revealed was significantly underdosed (74% of stated content). The patient's rapid clinical resolution with a standard course of quality-assured quinine and doxycycline supported this conclusion over drug resistance or a co-infection.\n**Disease Name Short**: Falciparum malaria""]","Diagnosis: Falciparum malaria
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with falciparum malaria. The profound thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are characteristic of severe malaria, and the patient's rapid deterioration and progression to refractory viral sepsis are also consistent with falciparum malaria.

While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis\n\n## Case 94---A-20-Year-Old-Woman-from-the-Democratic-Republic-_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.806)\n**Patient Information**: A 20-year-old woman from a rural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has no relevant past medical history and is the mother of three children. Notably, she was born after the worldwide smallpox vaccination programs were stopped in the early 1980s.\n**Chief Complaint**: A history of fever, malaise, headache, dry cough, and neck swelling, followed by a disseminated skin rash.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient developed fever, malaise, headache, and a dry cough. Two days later, a disseminated skin rash appeared, beginning on her face and spreading centrifugally to her body, including the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. The skin lesions evolved from macules to papules, then vesicles, and finally to pustules. The oral lesions were painful, making it difficult to eat and drink.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in a rural agricultural village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area where monkeypox is endemic. She is part of a population with waning herd immunity to orthopoxviruses, as she was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A specific animal or human contact was not identified, which is common in such settings.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed disseminated, uniform, umbilicated vesiculopustular skin lesions measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, with a predilection for the face, hands, and feet. There was generalized lymphadenopathy with prominent swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the lungs, heart, abdomen, and central nervous system was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results at presentation included a White Blood Cell count of 4.4 x 10^9/L (73% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and an elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. The diagnosis was made clinically, as definitive laboratory testing such as PCR or culture is often unavailable in endemic regions.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses for this vesiculopustular rash included poxvirus infections. Monkeypox was the main suspicion due to the endemic location, rash characteristics, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Varicella was also considered but is less likely given the uniform stage of the lesions and palm/sole involvement. Cowpox was deemed unlikely as it usually presents with a single lesion and uncommonly causes significant fever or lymphadenopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: Management was exclusively supportive, as no specific treatment is available for monkeypox. The patient made an uneventful recovery but was left with scarring from the skin lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is human monkeypox, made on clinical grounds. This is supported by the patient's presentation with a febrile prodrome followed by a characteristic centrifugal, vesiculopustular rash with lesions in a uniform stage of development, including on the palms and soles. The presence of prominent lymphadenopathy and the patient's residence in an endemic area of the DRC further support this diagnosis over differentials like varicella. Her age indicates she was not vaccinated against smallpox, increasing her susceptibility.\n**Disease Name Short**: Human monkeypox\n\n## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.797)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 77---A-51-Year-Old-Female-Traveller-Returning-from-Cen_2022_Clinical-Cases-i (score=0.793)\n**Patient Information**: A 51-year-old female Swiss traveller with no reported chronic underlying diseases and not taking any medication.\n**Chief Complaint**: Presentation with a generalized rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral edema for two days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Four days after returning from her trip, the patient developed a generalized, slightly pruritic maculopapular rash on her face, trunk, and extremities. There was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. The following day, the rash worsened and she developed non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. She presented to the outpatient department six days after her return.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting to medical care 6 days after her return. The incubation period is consistent with an arboviral infection acquired in Central America.\n**Vitals**: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed non-purulent conjunctivitis and a generalized maculopapular rash that also involved the face. Additionally, there was tender edema of the hands, elbows, knees, and feet, along with generalized lymphadenopathy affecting the cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests showed a normal full blood count and liver function tests. CRP was slightly elevated at 8 mg/L and creatinine was very mildly elevated at 87 µmol/L. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue and chikungunya were negative. Subsequent testing at a reference laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection by a positive RT-PCR on an initial blood sample. Paired serology showed seroconversion, with a Zika IgM titer of 1:640 and a significant rise in Zika IgG from 1:20 to 1:5120. A rise in Dengue IgG was also noted but interpreted as cross-reactivity.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical presentation was considered highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The primary differential diagnoses included the three most important arboviruses in Central and South America: dengue, chikungunya, and zika. Although they can have similar presentations, the combination of a skin rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral edema in an afebrile patient was considered highly indicative of a Zika virus infection.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The case notes that arboviral infections are self-limiting and management is exclusively supportive, as there are no specific treatment options. The specific supportive care provided to this patient and her clinical outcome were not detailed.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Acute Zika virus infection was diagnosed. The confirmation was based on a positive Zika virus RT-PCR from a blood sample taken 6 days after symptom onset. The diagnosis was further supported by seroconversion in paired serum samples, which demonstrated a positive Zika IgM and a significant rise in Zika IgG titer. Dengue and chikungunya were ruled out by negative tests, and the rise in Dengue IgG was attributed to serological cross-reactivity common among flaviviruses.\n**Disease Name Short**: Zika virus infection""]","Diagnosis: Histoplasmosis
Reason: The patient presented with a disseminated skin rash, which is characteristic of histoplasmosis. The patient's history of travel to an endemic area for histoplasmosis, along with the presence of multiple skin lesions in various stages of evolution, supports the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.","The final diagnosis is Monkeypox (Mpox). This is supported by the patient's presentation with a characteristic diffuse skin rash (pustules, papules, vesicles) in the context of being immunocompromised and having a recent travel history. Although she presented with atypical symptoms like abdominal pain and had pulmonary nodules on CT, the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting viral DNA via a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.",0.2165707776388753,0.8888888888888888,0.9999999999
"A 27-year-old Ugandan woman with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV presented with a two-month history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. She had a remote history of lower back pain treated as lumbago two years prior, but denied recent constitutional symptoms like cough or weight loss. Examination revealed a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine. An initial ultrasound suggested a psoas abscess. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh.

She has no reported comorbidities or allergies.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset symptoms including fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a slight non-productive cough. On admission, she was prostrate and semiconscious.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in northern Uganda. She was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the region, which made the diagnosis strongly suspected. She denied any contact with sick people.\n**Vitals**: On admission, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Her condition later worsened to a temperature of 36.0°C, an unreadable blood pressure, a pulse of 150 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 36 cycles per minute.\n**Physical Exam**: On admission, the patient was prostrate and semiconscious. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding from the gums. Her lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted initially. As her condition worsened, she developed subconjunctival haemorrhage and copious bleeding from the mouth, nose, and rectum.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initially, no clinical laboratory data were available because routine testing was suspended for biosafety reasons during the outbreak. Post-mortem testing was performed at a specialized laboratory, which showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for the ELISA IgG antibody.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was Ebola virus disease due to the presentation occurring during a known outbreak. The text notes that the differential diagnosis for a viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome is broad and includes other syndromes that can present with haemorrhage, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to a specialized isolation ward. Management included intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. Despite this care, her condition rapidly worsened. She developed worsening haemorrhage (subconjunctival, oral, nasal, rectal), dyspnoea, and progressed to hypothermic shock. She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Ebola virus disease. This was confirmed by post-mortem laboratory testing at a specialized facility, which found a positive ELISA antigen test and a positive PCR test for Ebola virus, along with a negative ELISA IgG antibody. The clinical presentation of a rapid-onset febrile illness progressing to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and severe haemorrhage in the context of an ongoing Ebola outbreak was classic for the disease.\n**Disease Name Short**: Ebola virus disease\n\n## Case 11---A-45-Year-Old-Male-Security-Guard-from-Malawi-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-T (score=0.800)\n**Patient Information**: A 45-year-old security guard from Malawi with no history of trauma or past tuberculosis. His HIV status was initially unknown but he was later found to be HIV-positive. He is a non-smoker but drinks about one litre of a locally brewed beer daily. He is married with three children who are all well.\n**Chief Complaint**: Back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient's troubles started one year prior with back pain, for which he was given paracetamol without improvement. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and 'pins and needles' sensations in his legs. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months until he became bedridden. He denies fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough, and reports no haematuria or diarrhoea, remaining continent for stool and urine.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in an urban area in Malawi where he worked as a security guard until he became unemployed due to his illness. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and back. He has never been tested for HIV before this illness. No sick contacts were reported.\n**Vitals**: On a visit to a health center three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5°C (99.5°F). At the time of the main hospital admission and examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n**Physical Exam**: Examination revealed tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs, with visible contractures. Power in his legs was 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs were exaggerated, and plantar reflexes were upgoing. A sensory level for pain and temperature was found between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and upper limbs was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count results were normal. The patient tested positive for HIV with a CD4 count of 331 cells/µL. Urine dipstick was normal, and no ova of Schistosoma spp. were found in urine or stool. A spinal radiograph showed a collapse of the T11 vertebral body and associated soft tissue swelling around the spine. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examinations were normal.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The clinical signs of spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level localize the lesion to the spinal cord. Differential diagnoses for non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in this setting include spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease), spinal metastases, and degenerative spinal disease. Non-compressive causes considered were schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of spinal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment, along with vitamin B6. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counseling were initiated. A spinal surgeon did not recommend surgical intervention at the time. The patient was discharged home with involvement from the palliative care team. At 4 weeks, he was started on antiretroviral therapy. By the 3-month follow-up, his neurological deficits remained clinically unchanged, though he reported some subjective improvement in his gait. He missed his neurosurgical follow-up appointment due to transportation issues.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) with compressive myelopathy. This is based on the clinical syndrome of chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, the patient's HIV-positive status, and characteristic radiological findings of a T11 vertebral body collapse with a paravertebral soft tissue mass. Other relevant tropical etiologies like schistosomiasis were ruled out by negative laboratory tests. The diagnosis was further supported by the decision to commence antituberculous therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.799)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout.

She has a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior to presentation, which was treated as malaria. She is married with 3 children, with the last born 12 months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative, and there is no past or family history of similar illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: Loss of power and feeling in her legs, with onset two days prior to referral.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient was well until two days before presentation, when she experienced acute, severe, continuous, burning back pain that radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. Within 12 hours, the pain lessened, but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, along with loss of power in her legs and loss of bladder control. This presentation was preceded by a febrile illness 3 weeks earlier.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient resides in northern Tanzania. She had a febrile illness 3 weeks prior that was treated as malaria. There is no reported history of trauma.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs were reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: General examination was unremarkable, with no spinal tenderness, deformity, or gibbus. On neurological exam, she was fully oriented with normal higher mental functions, cranial nerves, and upper limbs. The lower limbs showed a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. Tone was reduced bilaterally, power was MRC grade 1/5 in all muscle groups, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were extensor. Sensation was reduced to light touch up to the umbilicus, with impaired joint position sense in the feet and ankles, and absent vibration sense up to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Full blood count, renal, and liver function tests were normal. The ESR was 19 mm/h. HIV serology (and p24 antigen), VDRL, and schistosomiasis serology were all negative. Urine and stool tests for Schistosoma ova were also negative. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal opening pressure. CSF analysis showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), an elevated protein of 1.11 g/L, and a normal glucose of 3.9 mmol/l. CSF Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF, and VDRL were all negative. X-rays of the chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnoses included lesions of peripheral nerves (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies) and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the T10 level and extensor plantar reflexes localized the lesion to the spinal cord. Among myelopathies, the key differentials were acute spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) and vascular spinal cord ischemia. The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein were suggestive of inflammation, favoring acute transverse myelitis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir. She received supportive care including urinary catheterization and physiotherapy. After 3 weeks, she showed partial improvement, with leg power increasing to MRC grade 2-3/5. She was discharged with a urinary catheter in situ for outpatient review.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis. This is based on the clinical presentation of acute-onset flaccid paraplegia with a distinct T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, which localizes the lesion to the spinal cord. The diagnosis is further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, indicating inflammation. Compressive lesions were ruled out by normal spinal X-rays, and specific infectious etiologies like syphilis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis were excluded by negative tests, making this a case of non-compressive myelitis, likely parainfectious given the preceding febrile illness.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute transverse myelitis""]","Diagnosis: Acute psoas abscess
Reason: The patient presented with a psoas abscess, which is a common complication of HIV infection. The patient's history of well-controlled HIV and the presence of a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine are consistent with a psoas abscess. The CT scan findings of extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh are also consistent with a psoas abscess.","The diagnosis is Pott disease, or spinal tuberculosis. This is supported by the patient's risk factors (HIV infection, living in an endemic area) and the clinical findings of a spinal deformity (gibbus) and a large abscess. The CT scan findings of lytic vertebral destruction and a paravertebral cold abscess are classic for this condition. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying acid-fast bacilli on a Ziehl-Neelsen stain and detecting rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis via GeneXpert on a sample from the drained abscess.",0.4726394246312768,0.0,0.9999999999
"A 10-year-old Tibetan girl presented with a two-month history of moderate to severe headache and nonprojectile vomiting. She had no fever or initial seizures. An important epidemiological clue was that six of her schoolmates presented with similar symptoms and were suspected of having cysticercosis. Laboratory tests showed a mild peripheral eosinophilia and slightly elevated protein and white blood cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. A brain MRI was performed and showed numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum. Some of these lesions had a characteristic ""hole-with-dot"" appearance, and serum ELISA was positive for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.

She has followed a strict vegan diet for the past 8 years.\n**Chief Complaint**: An episode of strange sensations on the right side of the body.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a single episode of 'pins and needles' sensations that started on the right side of her face, marched to her right arm, and then involved her right leg, lasting for about 2 minutes. This was consistent with a Jacksonian 'sensory march' or focal epileptic seizure. A similar episode had occurred several months prior, for which she did not seek medical attention.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Four years prior to presentation, the patient completed a 2-year backpacking trip through endemic regions in South America (Ecuador, Peru, Argentina) and South-east Asia (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia). During her travels, she stayed in hostels and with local people in the countryside. Her diet consisted of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and rice from local vendors, with no animal products. This history is relevant as neurocysticercosis is acquired by consuming food or water contaminated with Taenia solium eggs.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared well. Her neurological examination was completely unremarkable, and the rest of her physical examination was also normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Routine blood investigations, including differential blood count and C-reactive protein, were normal. The CSF examination was also unremarkable. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium enhancement revealed multiple cortical and subcortical cystic lesions in both hemispheres, some containing a scolex ('central dot'). Some lesions showed perifocal edema and ring-enhancement. The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) for anticysticercal antibodies in both serum and CSF.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was neurocysticercosis. This was based on the combination of a focal epileptic seizure, extensive travel history to endemic areas in South America and Asia, and characteristic neuroimaging findings of multiple cystic brain lesions in various stages (vesicular and colloidal), despite a normal physical exam and lack of systemic inflammation.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days and started on antiepileptic drugs. She declined adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. She remained seizure-free for over a year. A follow-up MRI at 1 year showed regression of all cysts, and a CT scan at 2 years showed two calcifications. Her antiepileptic medication was stopped after a seizure-free period of 3 years.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a focal seizure, characteristic MRI findings of multiple cystic cerebral lesions, and an epidemiological link through extensive travel in endemic regions. It was definitively confirmed by positive serology (EITB) in both serum and CSF.\n**Disease Name Short**: Neurocysticercosis\n\n## Case 64---A-40-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-and-Her-Bro_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.821)\n**Patient Information**: A 40-year-old Thai woman, a housewife who has lived in Germany for the past 13 years, with an unremarkable past medical history. She presented to an outpatient clinic in Germany.\n**Chief Complaint**: Severe headache for the past 8 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient reported an 8-day history of severe, gradual-onset headache that did not respond to painkillers. She denied fever, chills, visual problems, limb weakness, or memory problems. Three days earlier, she had presented to a municipal hospital where a CT scan of her brain and a blood count were both normal. Her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared meals while traveling, also developed a severe headache.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Ten days prior to presentation, the patient returned from a 4-week journey to north-east Thailand, where she visited friends and relatives. During her visit, she ate traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. The occurrence of similar symptoms in her brother-in-law after sharing meals suggests a common source outbreak.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a supple neck and a negative Lasègue's sign. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, with no cranial nerve palsies. The remainder of the neurological examination was unremarkable, including higher cortical functions. There was no rash, oral thrush, subcutaneous swellings, lymphadenopathy, or enlargement of the liver and spleen. The cardiopulmonary examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (WBC 12.3 x 10⁹/L) with marked peripheral eosinophilia (2.34 x 10⁹/L) and an elevated IgE of 944 U/mL. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 34 cmH2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 1877 leukocytes/µL with 42% eosinophils, elevated protein at 1.59 g/L, and low glucose at 1.85 mmol/L. CSF microscopy, cultures, and antigen tests for bacteria and fungi were negative. After discharge, serology results came back positive, with a Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD antigen of Angiostrongylus cantonensis.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The presumptive diagnosis was a food-borne parasitic infection causing eosinophilic meningitis, supported by the travel history, dietary exposure, and peripheral eosinophilia. The main differential diagnoses for eosinophilic meningitis considered included fungal infections, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Other parasitic causes such as neurocysticercosis, fascioliasis, and paragonimiasis were ruled out by negative serologies.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient underwent repeated lumbar punctures, which relieved her headache. She was prescribed iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia but received no specific antiparasitic treatment. After a one-week hospital stay, she was discharged significantly improved. At a 4-week follow-up, she had fully recovered, and her peripheral eosinophil count had returned to normal.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis due to infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis. This is supported by the clinical presentation of severe headache, the exposure history involving consumption of potential intermediate hosts like snails or frogs in an endemic region, and laboratory findings of marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot test showing specific antibodies against the 31kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen.\n**Disease Name Short**: Angiostrongyliasis\n\n## Case 82---A-31-Year-Old-Man-from-Guatemala-With-Acute-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro (score=0.781)\n**Patient Information**: A 31-year-old Guatemalan man with no past medical history. He was born and lived in a rural area of Guatemala before immigrating to New York 5 years prior to presentation.\n**Chief Complaint**: Acute weakness and numbness of the leg, lasting several minutes.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with several minutes of weakness and numbness of the leg, which resolved just before his arrival at the hospital, consistent with a transitory ischemic attack. Two weeks previously, he had experienced two episodes of facial twitching, each lasting about 10 seconds and subsiding without intervention.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lived in a rural area of Guatemala until 5 years ago. While in Guatemala, his family owned uncorralled pigs and his home did not have sanitation services. These are significant epidemiological risk factors for cysticercosis.\n**Vitals**: Vital signs on presentation were normal.\n**Physical Exam**: On clinical examination, cranial nerves were intact, and motor and sensory examinations were normal. Deep tendon reflexes and gait were also normal. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial cell blood count and serum chemistry were within normal limits. A serum immunoblot for cysticercosis from the CDC was positive, and the serum cysticercosis antigen was also positive at the beginning of therapy. Imaging included a head CT which demonstrated multiple calcifications in the brain parenchyma. An MRI of the head revealed dilation of the suprasellar and Sylvian cisterns, peripheral enhancement after gadolinium administration, fluid-filled septated cystic lesions surrounding the proximal middle cerebral arteries, and an old lacunar infarct. A CT angiography showed patent cerebral arteries. An MRI of the spine did not show evidence of spinal involvement.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was neurocysticercosis, specifically the subarachnoid form (SANCC). This was strongly suggested by the combination of epidemiological risk factors (originating from an endemic area with pig contact and poor sanitation), a clinical presentation of transient neurological events (facial twitching, TIA), and characteristic imaging findings of parenchymal calcifications and complex subarachnoid cysts.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was treated with a high dose of prednisone followed by a taper, along with dual antiparasitic therapy using albendazole and praziquantel. After 9 months of treatment, his serum antigen became negative, and his lesions resolved on follow-up imaging. He has been followed closely and has had no recurrence of symptoms.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC), caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium. This was confirmed by a positive serum immunoblot for cysticercosis. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's epidemiological history from rural Guatemala, the clinical presentation of transient neurological deficits, and extensive neuroimaging findings including parenchymal calcifications, subarachnoid cysts, and evidence of a prior lacunar infarct. The patient's positive response to antiparasitic and steroid therapy further solidifies the diagnosis.\n**Disease Name Short**: Subarachnoid Neurocysticercosis\n\n## Case 6---A-36-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-B_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tro (score=0.774)\n**Patient Information**: A 36-year-old male restaurant owner, who is married. HIV antibody testing was negative. He has no other reported significant medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: A mobile, itchy mass under the skin, which has been migrating for three weeks.\n**History Of Present Illness**: Three weeks ago, the patient first noted a mass in his groin that subsided after four days. He then developed an itchy, serpiginous rash that tracked from his groin to his chest, moved over several days, and then disappeared. The mass subsequently reappeared on his right shoulder, prompting him to seek assessment. There was no history of fever or systemic illness.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: Five weeks prior to presentation, the patient returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. During the trip, he swam in fresh river water and ate freshwater fish from the river, which he later admitted included making sushi. Two of the four friends who accompanied him had the same complaint. The patient took malaria chemoprophylaxis and slept under a mosquito net. He denies any sexual contact on the trip.\n**Vitals**: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\n**Physical Exam**: Organ system examination was normal. On his right upper deltoid, there was a firm mass with clear margins, measuring 3 x 8 cm. A serpiginous tract was visible, and the mass had reportedly migrated recently across his upper chest wall. There was no additional rash and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Laboratory results showed a total white cell count of 8.9 ×10^9/L and a significant peripheral eosinophilia with an eosinophil count of 0.9 × 10^9/L (reference <0.5). Liver function tests, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. HIV antibody testing was negative. Serology for Gnathostoma was negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was gnathostomiasis, given the classic presentation of a mobile subcutaneous mass, creeping eruption, and eosinophilia. Other parasitic causes were considered, including Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), which was deemed unlikely as it is not endemic to the exposure area and has a longer incubation period. Sparganosis, another cause of migratory swelling, was considered very rare. Cutaneous larva migrans from hookworms and Strongyloides were also considered less likely as they typically cause fine tracks, not a large mobile mass.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous gnathostomiasis was made, and treatment was initiated with albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 21 days and a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg. During the first six days of treatment, the lesion migrated over his shoulder and neck, disappeared for 24 hours, then reappeared between his eyebrows, moved to his forehead and face, and was felt inside his nose. On the sixth day, the patient expressed a larva from his nostril, which was identified as Gnathostoma spinigerum. His two symptomatic friends were also treated and had full resolution of their symptoms.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is cutaneous gnathostomiasis caused by the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum. This was confirmed by the direct identification of the larva after it was expressed from the patient's nostril. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the clinical syndrome of a migratory subcutaneous mass (larva migrans profundus), significant eosinophilia, and a history of consuming raw freshwater fish in an endemic area (Botswana). The initial negative serology does not rule out the disease, which was proven parasitologically.\n**Disease Name Short**: Gnathostomiasis""]","Diagnosis: Neurocysticercosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including headache, nonprojectile vomiting, and no fever, are consistent with neurocysticercosis. The presence of multiple cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum on the brain MRI, along with the characteristic ""hole-with-dot"" appearance on the serum ELISA, are also indicative of neurocysticercosis. The patient's age and the presence of six schoolmates with similar symptoms also support the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.","The diagnosis is massive neurocysticercosis, caused by infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This is supported by the chronic headache in a child from an endemic region with a cluster of similar cases among her schoolmates. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuroimaging and serology. The brain MRI showed numerous cystic lesions with the pathognomonic ""hole-with-dot"" sign (representing the scolex within the cyst), and serum ELISA for anticysticercal IgG antibodies was positive. The patient's good response to antiparasitic treatment with albendazole and praziquantel further supported the diagnosis.",0.8208598006264609,0.4444444444444444,0.9999999999
"A 49-year-old man was hospitalized for fever, rigors, and diarrhea. His medical history is significant for a trip to Peru eight weeks prior. Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210. Liver function tests were also abnormal, and a blood culture was positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Tests for malaria, dengue, and other common travel-related infections were negative.","[""## Case 87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.838)\n**Patient Information**: A 27-year-old male Swiss tourist with no other reported comorbidities or immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: Persisting and incapacitating polyarthralgias after returning from travel to the Peruvian Amazon.\n**History Of Present Illness**: During the second week of a trip to Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash that started on the forearms and spread to the trunk, neck, and face before fading in 3 days. This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 61---A-48-Year-Old-Woman-from-Thailand-With-Fever-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.826)\n**Patient Information**: A 46-year-old Thai woman, with a BMI of 26 kg/m², transferred to a German clinic. A subsequent diagnostic work-up found no evidence of immunosuppression.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 2-month history of recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive illness that began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. While in Thailand, she experienced an acute illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This evolved into recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Despite various antibiotic therapies, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Previous pus and blood cultures yielded no growth, and a lymph node biopsy had shown non-specific lymphadenitis.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient's symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after returning from a family visit to northern Thailand, an endemic area for histoplasmosis. While there, she had suffered from an acute febrile illness, which in retrospect may have been acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n**Vitals**: On admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes. There was massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids and disseminated, fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema, which discharged pus on slight pressure. The left elbow was also painfully swollen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Admission labs showed marked inflammation with a white cell count of 30.8 x 10⁹/L, anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (Platelets 592 x 10⁹/L), an elevated CRP of 267 mg/L, and an ESR >110 mm/h. A radiograph of the left elbow revealed osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondyle, osteomyelitis, and articular effusion. Histopathology of a submandibular lymph node showed fungal cells, which were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR and later confirmed by culture. Serology for histoplasmosis remained negative throughout. CSF analysis during a later seizure showed lymphocytic pleocytosis without direct pathogen detection.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential was a systemic infection. Given the failure of antibiotics and negative standard cultures, atypical infections were considered, including fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, and specific bacteria like Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Brucella, or Actinomyces. Melioidosis was the initial suspected diagnosis. An underlying immunodeficiency was also considered but ultimately ruled out.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was initially treated with imipenem for suspected melioidosis, which led to only slight improvement. After diagnosis, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), during which she developed a generalized seizure thought to be a cerebral manifestation of the disease. Her clinical state and laboratory findings improved dramatically with antifungal therapy. She was discharged on itraconazole maintenance therapy for an additional 6 months. On follow-up, she was in fair condition with resolved lymphadenopathy and partly recalcified bone lesions.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and subsequent culture of a submandibular lymph node biopsy, which revealed the fungus. This was established despite negative serology and initial sterile cultures. The clinical syndrome of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and travel history to an endemic region, combined with a dramatic response to antifungal therapy, solidified the diagnosis over other differentials like melioidosis or typical bacterial infections.\n**Disease Name Short**: Histoplasmosis\n\n## Case 20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.823)\n**Patient Information**: A 43-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever for the past 3 days.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presents on May 21st with a three-day history of recurrent fever, with a temperature as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F) the day before presentation. He also reports some headache and diarrhoea. He had a prior episode of fever from April 27th to April 29th while travelling, for which he self-treated with atovaquone/proguanil for presumed malaria.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient travelled to Mozambique from April 16th to April 30th, followed by a trip to Chile from April 30th to May 17th. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique. He reports a specific exposure of freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo.\n**Vitals**: On examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). His temperature the day prior was reported as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The physical examination was normal except for the fever. There was no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly, and no lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results on admission showed a normal WBC count (9.0 x 10^9/L) but marked eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver function tests were elevated (AST 106 U/L, ALT 179 U/L, GGT 186 U/L), along with LDH (422 U/L) and C-reactive protein (57.9 mg/L). An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph and subsequent CT scan revealed bilateral nodular lesions ranging from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones. Thick films for Plasmodium were negative, and initial microscopy for Schistosoma eggs in stool and urine were negative three times. Initial antischistosomal antibody tests (enzyme-immunoassay and IFA) were also negative. Four weeks later, repeat testing showed positive antischistosomal antibodies (IFA 1:1280; cercarial- and egg-ELISA positive), and Schistosoma mansoni ova were found in the stool.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial differential diagnosis for fever in a returning traveler included malaria, typhoid fever, and amoebic liver abscess. Other considerations given the elevated liver enzymes included viral hepatitis (including E, EBV, CMV), leptospirosis, and rickettsioses. However, the prominent eosinophilia strongly pointed towards a helminth infection. The combination of fever, eosinophilia, and freshwater exposure made acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) the most relevant differential diagnosis, with acute fascioliasis being a rarer alternative.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: After initial investigations for malaria and other infections were negative, the patient underwent repeat testing. Following the delayed confirmation of schistosomiasis via serology and stool microscopy four weeks after presentation, the patient was treated with praziquantel. The case notes that praziquantel is less effective against immature flukes and treatment is often delayed until the infection is patent (eggs are detectable).\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) caused by Schistosoma mansoni. This was established by the detection of S. mansoni ova in the stool and strongly positive serology (IFA 1:1280) four weeks after initial presentation. The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.823)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease""]","Diagnosis: Salmonellosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms of fever, rigors, and diarrhea are consistent with Salmonellosis. The presence of anemia, an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level are also characteristic of Salmonellosis. The blood culture result is positive for Salmonella enteritidis, which is a common cause of Salmonellosis. Additionally, the patient's travel history to Peru eight weeks prior and the presence of Salmonella enteritidis in the blood culture suggest a travel-related infection.","The diagnosis is the chronic phase of Oroya fever, known as verruga peruana, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis. This is supported by the patient's travel history to Peru, an endemic region, and the classic biphasic presentation. He initially had an acute febrile illness with anemia (acute Oroya fever), followed by the development of characteristic red vascular skin nodules (verruga peruana). The concurrent Salmonella enteritidis bacteremia is a well-known complication of the immunosuppression associated with acute Oroya fever.

The clinical syndrome of fever, marked eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and pulmonary nodules, following a clear history of freshwater exposure in an endemic area (Mozambique), is classic for this condition.\n**Disease Name Short**: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)\n\n## Case 47---A-32-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-a-Pain_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropic (score=0.812)\n**Patient Information**: A 32-year-old Malawian man with a known history of HIV, who was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis two months prior to presentation. His recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL. His past medical history is significant for treatment for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and a painfully swollen neck.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The patient presented with a six-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, accompanied by a painful neck swelling. Despite being started on TB treatment upon admission, his condition did not improve after three weeks. He continued to experience fevers, night sweats, and lack of appetite, and the glands in his neck became progressively more swollen and fluctuant.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from Malawi and had not left the country. Multi-drug resistance for TB is noted to be uncommon in this region. No other specific occupational or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, he was moderately ill, pale, and sweating with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), a pulse of 112 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was reported as normal.\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing man with large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. Over the course of his hospital stay, these glands became more swollen and clearly fluctuant. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial blood count revealed a WBC of 14.3×10^9/L, severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, MCV 66 fL), and platelets of 246×10^9/L. Three sputum samples were negative for AFB. However, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yielded purulent material that was 2+ positive for AFB on microscopy. Blood cultures showed no growth. Follow-up investigations showed a CD4 count of 109 cells/µL and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA. A repeat FNA of the fluctuant neck mass showed frank yellowish pus, with microscopy revealing numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes; bacterial culture results were never received.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The initial diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis. The subsequent lack of clinical improvement raised several possibilities, including infection with atypical mycobacteria, drug resistance, non-adherence, or malabsorption. Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was also strongly considered. With the development of fluctuance, a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis was deemed probable, while lymphoma was considered less likely.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted and started on a TB repeat treatment regimen (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) while continuing his ART. Due to clinical deterioration suspected to be paradoxical IRIS, corticosteroids were initiated. The increasingly fluctuant neck mass was managed with incision and drainage, and the patient received antibiotic treatment. He recovered well following this multimodal therapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and a superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis in a patient with advanced HIV. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by a fine-needle aspirate of a neck gland showing AFB 2+ positive material. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically due to the worsening of symptoms after starting appropriate TB therapy in the setting of recent ART initiation and immune recovery. The bacterial superinfection was confirmed by a second aspirate showing pus and coccoid bacteria, with clinical resolution after incision, drainage, and antibiotic therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with IRIS\n\n## Case 44---A-7-Year-Old-Girl-from-South-Sudan-With-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropica (score=0.812)\n**Patient Information**: A 7-year-old girl from South Sudan, described as severely malnourished with a Z-score less than -3. She has never been admitted to a hospital before the current illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 4-week history of undulating fever.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For four weeks, the patient experienced an undulating fever, mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was fine between febrile episodes, but over time she developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain. She had recently received unspecified tablets from another clinic which provided no improvement.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is from South Sudan. Her mother reported that the family came from an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was known. The patient's uncle had previously been treated for VL, and her sister had recently been treated for tuberculosis (TB).\n**Vitals**: On presentation, vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert, pale, and not jaundiced. She had a soft abdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal margin. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes about 1 cm in diameter in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear regions. Her chest sounds were clear and heart sounds were normal. No skin lesions or peripheral oedema were present.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia: WBC 1.35 ×10⁹/L, Haemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, and Platelets 98 ×10⁹/L. A Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood film for malaria were negative. Brucella species serology (IgG and IgM) was negative. An initial visceral leishmaniasis rK39-antibody RDT was also negative. However, a subsequent Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for visceral leishmaniasis was positive with a high titre (≥1:6,400).\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses included visceral leishmaniasis and brucellosis due to the chronic fever, splenomegaly, and wasting. Tuberculosis and HIV infection were also considered. Malaria was deemed unlikely after two negative tests and an atypical chronic course. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) was also considered but does not typically present with fever or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions like typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma were also part of the differential.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's condition initially deteriorated with persistent high fever and increasing pallor. Due to her critical state with severe malnutrition and progressive anaemia, she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). She also received nutritional support with high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation. After five days of treatment, the fever settled and she began to recover. Two weeks later, she had gained weight and was able to walk and play again.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). This was based on the clinical presentation of chronic fever, wasting, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia in a child from an endemic area. Although an initial rapid test (rK39 RDT) was negative, the diagnosis was supported by a subsequent positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre (≥1:6,400) and confirmed by the patient's positive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\n**Disease Name Short**: Visceral leishmaniasis\n\n## Case 59---A-24-Year-Old-Man-from-Malawi-With-Skin-Le_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropi (score=0.811)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old Malawian businessman recently diagnosed with HIV one week prior to presentation, with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. He has not yet started antiretroviral medication. He has no history of previous tuberculosis. His wife is also HIV-positive.\n**Chief Complaint**: Progressing dark skin spots for one month, new facial swelling, and a three-month history of cough and worsening shortness of breath.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past month, the patient noticed dark spots on his arm and leg that were progressing, and he subsequently developed facial swelling. He also reports a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum accompanied by worsening shortness of breath. He denied any constitutional symptoms, including weight loss, fevers, or night sweats.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient is a businessman from Malawi. His wife is also HIV-positive, and his two young children have not yet been tested. No other specific travel, animal, or environmental exposures are detailed.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, his temperature was 36°C (96.8°F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was comfortable at rest with moderate facial oedema. Examination revealed widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Respiratory assessment showed decreased air entry and dullness at the right lung base. His right leg was swollen from the foot to the knee, with prominent, coalescing dark plaques. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: The patient was confirmed to be HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 134 cells/µL. His hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and MCV was 88.4 fL. Sputum microscopy and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests were negative for tuberculosis. A chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifications with peribronchovascular changes in the lower and mid lung zones, noted as being typical for pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnoses were Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and pulmonary tuberculosis. The skin and palatal lesions were described as typical for KS, strongly suggesting the diagnosis and raising suspicion for pulmonary involvement. Tuberculosis was considered essential to rule out in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient with a chronic cough, especially as dual pathology with KS is not uncommon.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient's primary concern was shortness of breath. Investigations for tuberculosis were negative. A bronchoscopy was attempted but failed due to technical difficulties. He received a short course of oral antibiotics with no improvement. He was subsequently referred to start antiretroviral medication and palliative chemotherapy.\n**Final Diagnosis**: Kaposi's sarcoma with extensive cutaneous, palatal, and pulmonary involvement, occurring in the context of advanced, untreated HIV infection (AIDS). The diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical findings of widespread purplish plaques, a low CD4 count (134 cells/µL), and chest X-ray findings typical for pulmonary KS. Tuberculosis was actively considered and reasonably excluded based on negative sputum and GeneXpert tests.\n**Disease Name Short**: Kaposi's sarcoma""]","Diagnosis: Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with acute schistosomiasis, as described in the case studies. The patient's fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain are typical of the clinical presentation of this condition. The presence of hepato-splenomegaly and elevated transaminases are also characteristic of acute schistosomiasis. The chest X-ray being normal and the T-spot test for tuberculosis being negative are not specific for acute schistosomiasis but are not inconsistent with the diagnosis either.","The diagnosis is brucellosis, caused by a bacterium of the genus *Brucella*. The clinical picture of a pyrexia of unknown origin with night sweats, arthralgia, and hepato-splenomegaly in a traveler returning from an endemic region is highly suggestive. The characteristic undulant fever pattern and laboratory findings of pancytopenia further support the diagnosis. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the isolation of *Brucella* from a blood culture.",0.21236863233562267,0.42857142857142855,0.9999999999
"A 38-year-old man presented with a one-week history of high-grade intermittent fever, rigors, chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia. For the past two days, he has also experienced reddish-colored urine with clots and two episodes of gum bleeding. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, but he had multiple purpura and petechiae on his shoulder, trunk, and legs, as well as large ecchymotic lesions on his back. Laboratory studies revealed a very low platelet count of 20,000/μL and a low white blood cell count of 2.4 x 10^9/L. A tourniquet test was also positive.

This was accompanied by slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias with transient swelling in peripheral joints and painful, self-limiting cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While fever and other acute symptoms subsided within a week, the polyarthralgias persisted with a symmetrical pattern affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees, associated with morning stiffness. The joint pains remained unimproved for several months, prompting further medical evaluation.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. The illness began during the second week of this trip. Mayaro virus is known to circulate in this region in a sylvatic cycle involving forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with human infections representing incidental spillover from exposure in rainforest environments.\n**Vitals**: None\n**Physical Exam**: Physical examination upon his return to Switzerland was completely unremarkable. Examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or effusion. Earlier in the illness, he had experienced transient joint swelling and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Upon evaluation in Switzerland, the full blood count and liver function tests were normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (ref <5). Initial serological tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi were all negative. Subsequent alphavirus serology confirmed Mayaro virus infection, with an initial IgM-IFA of 1:280 and IgG-IFA of 1:2560, and a confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of 1:40. Follow-up testing showed a rising PRNT titer to 1:160. Serologies for Sindbis, Chikungunya, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses were negative.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: An initial clinical diagnosis of dengue fever was made in Peru. In Switzerland, the differential for persisting arthralgias included reactive arthritis and viral arthritis. Specific viral causes considered were parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella, and various alphaviruses. Reactive arthritis is often linked to HLA-B27 and triggered by GI or GU infections. Viral arthritis, especially from alphaviruses, was a strong consideration given the travel history and symmetrical small-joint involvement. Chikungunya was deemed less likely as it was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time of the patient's travel.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient initially received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol in Peru. After the diagnosis of Mayaro infection was confirmed, he was managed symptomatically with ibuprofen. The polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually disappearing completely. No permanent joint damage was reported.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus. This was confirmed by specific serological testing, which demonstrated positive IgM and IgG antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a positive, rising titer on the confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The clinical presentation of an acute febrile illness with rash followed by persistent, symmetrical polyarthralgias affecting small joints is characteristic of Mayaro virus, and the diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's recent travel to an endemic area in the Peruvian Amazon. Other infectious causes were ruled out by negative serology.\n**Disease Name Short**: Mayaro fever\n\n## Case 53---A-24-Year-Old-Woman-from-Uganda-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tropical (score=0.810)\n**Patient Information**: A 24-year-old woman from rural Uganda who was previously in good health. Her husband had recently died of a severe febrile illness.\n**Chief Complaint**: A 5-day history of a febrile illness.\n**History Of Present Illness**: The illness started with fever, a sore throat, and aching all over. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Over the course of five days, she became increasingly unwell, very weak, and needed help to stand.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient lives in rural Uganda. She had cared for her husband, who died at home from a severe febrile illness six days before her own illness began. The husband had worked in a local gold mine, an exposure associated with Marburg virus disease.\n**Vitals**: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38°C (100.4°F).\n**Physical Exam**: The patient appeared very unwell. Physical findings included bilateral conjunctivitis. There was no rash and no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria slide showed a low level of parasitaemia with P. falciparum. A sample was sent for PCR, which later returned positive for Marburg virus.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The differential included a wide range of acute infectious diseases. Malaria and typhoid fever were considered, but conjunctivitis made them less likely. Other causes of bacterial sepsis, as well as severe viral infections like adenovirus or influenza, were also possibilities. However, the suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), specifically Marburg virus disease, was raised due to the recent death of her husband from a similar illness and his known exposure to a mine.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: A presumed diagnosis of Marburg virus disease was made. The patient was isolated and managed with IV fluids for resuscitation. She was treated with IV artesunate followed by artemether/lumefantrine for malaria and given empirical IV ceftriaxone for possible sepsis. After remaining very unwell for several days, she began to improve. She was kept in isolation for an additional two days after recovery before being discharged home. Public health authorities were alerted and contacts were monitored.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease, which was confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. The patient also had a concurrent P. falciparum malaria co-infection, identified by a low level of parasitaemia on a malaria slide. The diagnosis of Marburg was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of fever and shock, conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her late husband who had a similar illness and worked in a mine.\n**Disease Name Short**: Marburg virus disease\n\n## Case 54---A-52-Year-Old-Male-Safari-Tourist-Returning-fro_2022_Clinical-Cases-in- (score=0.810)\n**Patient Information**: A 52-year-old man with an unremarkable past medical history.\n**Chief Complaint**: Fever for two days, accompanied by night sweats and a frontal headache.\n**History Of Present Illness**: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and frontal headache. He denied any joint pains or rash. The symptoms developed ten days after returning from a trip to South Africa.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday trip to South Africa, which concluded 10 days prior to presentation. His travel included visiting Cape Town, the Garden Route, KwaZulu-Natal, and going on safari in Kruger Park and other game reserves. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.\n**Vitals**: On examination, after having taken 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5°C (99.5°F). His pulse was 80 bpm and his blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was in fair general condition, with no jaundice and a supple neck. There were enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin. A small necrotic skin lesion (eschar), about 0.7 cm in diameter, was noted on his left upper thigh, with surrounding inflammation, lymphangiitis, and adjoining lymphadenitis.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: A malaria rapid diagnostic test, as well as thick and thin blood films for malaria, were both negative. The text notes that PCR from an eschar scab can confirm the diagnosis, but does not state if this was performed.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary diagnosis considered was African tick-bite fever, based on the typical eschar and recent travel history to an endemic safari region. Malaria was a critical differential diagnosis that needed to be ruled out, as the patient was a febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region (KwaZulu-Natal) without having taken chemoprophylaxis.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was prescribed doxycycline 100 mg twice daily by mouth for one week. Following treatment, the fever settled within a few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after approximately two weeks.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis was African tick-bite fever, a rickettsial disease caused by Rickettsia africae. The diagnosis was made clinically, based on the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and a history of safari travel in an endemic region of Southern Africa. Malaria, a key differential diagnosis, was excluded by negative rapid diagnostic tests and blood smears.\n**Disease Name Short**: African tick-bite fever\n\n## Case 92---A-42-Year-Old-Traveller-Returning-from-Thaila_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr (score=0.807)\n**Patient Information**: A 42-year-old German man with an unremarkable past medical history. He had not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis for his recent trip, which was in line with his home country's recommendations.\n**Chief Complaint**: A six-day history of fever up to 40°C, arthralgias, and retro-orbital pain.\n**History Of Present Illness**: For the past six days, the patient has experienced a fever reaching 40°C (104°F), along with joint pain (arthralgias) and retro-orbital pain. The symptoms began during a trip to Thailand, and he presented to a hospital in Germany the day after his return.\n**Exposure And Epidemiology**: The patient returned from a 10-week trip to Thailand the day before presentation. His travel included 2 months on Little Koh Chang in the Andaman Sea, 5 days in Hua Hin at the Gulf of Thailand, and 5 days in Bangkok. He did not take any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.\n**Vitals**: On examination, his temperature was 39.1°C (102.4°F), blood pressure was 156/80 mmHg, pulse was 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 was 95% on ambient air.\n**Physical Exam**: The patient was alert with a GCS of 15/15. There was no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation was clear. The abdominal examination was benign, showing no tenderness on palpation and no organomegaly.\n**Labs And Diagnostics**: Initial laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 81 × 10^9/L, an elevated CRP of 55 mg/L, and elevated liver enzymes (AST 62 U/L, ALT 106 U/L). A dengue NS1 antigen test and a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (detecting P. falciparum HRP-II and panmalarial aldolase) were both negative. Subsequent investigation with a thick blood film revealed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. A species-specific PCR later confirmed a mono-infection with P. knowlesi.\n**Differential Diagnosis**: The primary differential diagnosis was dengue fever, given the syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, and thrombocytopenia after travel to Thailand. However, the dengue NS1 test was negative. Other arboviral infections like Chikungunya and Zika were also considered. Influenza, acute HIV infection, and enteric fever were other possibilities. Malaria was a crucial consideration that had to be ruled out in any febrile traveler from an endemic area, as thrombocytopenia is a hallmark feature and rapid tests can be falsely negative, especially for non-falciparum species.\n**Management And Clinical Course**: The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Based on the suspicion of non-falciparum malaria, treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (250/100mg), four tablets once daily for three days. The patient responded well to treatment, recovered rapidly, and was discharged on the fourth day.\n**Final Diagnosis**: The final diagnosis is Knowlesi malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi. Although initial rapid tests for malaria and dengue were negative, a microscopic examination of a thick blood film revealed Plasmodium trophozoites. The specific species was then definitively identified as P. knowlesi by a species-specific PCR test. The diagnosis is consistent with the patient's travel history to Southeast Asia, clinical presentation of high fever and thrombocytopenia, and rapid response to appropriate antimalarial therapy.\n**Disease Name Short**: Knowlesi malaria""]","Diagnosis: Plasmodium knowlesi malaria
Reason: The patient presented with symptoms consistent with Plasmodium knowlesi malaria, including the presence of purpura and petechiae, as well as the low platelet count and white blood cell count. The tourniquet test was positive, which is a characteristic finding in Plasmodium knowlesi malaria. Additionally, the patient's travel history to Southeast Asia, which is a known malaria-endemic region, supports the diagnosis.","The diagnosis is Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a severe manifestation of infection with the Dengue virus. The clinical picture of a prolonged febrile illness with headache, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia is classic for dengue. The progression to hemorrhagic signs, including gum bleeding, hematuria, purpura, and ecchymoses, combined with severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, meets the criteria for DHF. The diagnosis was confirmed by serologic evidence of dengue virus infection.",0.20806736272628237,0.6,0.9999999999
