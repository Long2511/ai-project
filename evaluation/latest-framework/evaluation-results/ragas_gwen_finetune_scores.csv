Over the next few days, he developed leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia (23,000 cells/μl), and markedly elevated liver transaminases (AST >4900 U/L). He also showed signs of plasma leakage, including a rising hematocrit and free fluid on ultrasound.",[],"Diagnosis: Dengue encephalitis
Reason: The patient presented with a one-day history of high fever, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and subsequent left-sided hemiparesis, which are characteristic symptoms of dengue encephalitis. The MRI findings of right-sided meningoencephalitis also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, including leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, and markedly elevated liver transaminases, are consistent with the clinical presentation of dengue encephalitis.","The final diagnosis is dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated by parainfectious dengue encephalitis. This is supported by the patient's presentation with an acute febrile illness and neurological signs in a dengue-endemic region. The development of severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, markedly elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of plasma leakage (rising hematocrit, free fluid on ultrasound) confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis of dengue encephalitis was established by a positive serum dengue NS1 antigen test and positive serum dengue IgM, combined with MRI findings of encephalitis and the later detection of dengue IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid, after excluding other common causes of viral encephalitis.",0.6993770106987622
"A 47-year-old Belgian woman, who was not vaccinated, developed an acute illness during a one-week vacation in The Gambia. Her symptoms began with high fever, chills, headache, back pain, and severe asthenia. Upon returning to Europe, she was admitted to an intensive care unit with jaundice, anuria, and profound weakness. Laboratory evaluation revealed thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, acute kidney injury, and extremely elevated liver transaminases (AST 49,000 U/L, ALT 23,000 U/L). She subsequently developed a severe coagulopathy with an elevated INR, leading to bleeding from injection sites and massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which resulted in hypovolemic shock and death.",[],"Diagnosis: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
Reason: The patient developed severe asthenia, high fever, chills, headache, back pain, jaundice, anuria, and profound weakness, which are characteristic symptoms of ADEM.","The diagnosis is Yellow Fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the yellow fever virus. This is strongly supported by the patient's travel to an endemic area (The Gambia) without prior vaccination. Her clinical course was classic, featuring an acute febrile phase followed by a toxic phase with jaundice, renal failure, extremely high liver enzymes, and a severe coagulopathy leading to fatal hemorrhage. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for yellow fever virus on a plasma sample.",0.20366054676389742
"A 36-year-old female nurse in Nigeria presented with a three-day history of high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, and vomiting. She had not improved after treatment with antimalarials and ciprofloxacin. On admission, she was febrile, toxic-appearing, dehydrated, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Her condition worsened over the next day with a fever spike to 40.0°C, restlessness, facial puffiness, and respiratory distress with basal lung crepitations. A bedside whole blood clotting time was markedly prolonged at over 20 minutes, although no overt bleeding was observed. Initial laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count and negative blood and urine cultures.",[],"Diagnosis: Severe malaria
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including high-grade fever, chills, severe headache, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, and a prolonged whole blood clotting time, are consistent with severe malaria.","The diagnosis is Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. This is supported by the patient's presentation as a healthcare worker in an endemic area (Nigeria) with a severe febrile illness unresponsive to antimalarials and antibiotics. The clinical picture progressed to include facial edema, respiratory distress, and a significant coagulopathy (prolonged clotting time), which are features of severe Lassa fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by a viral study, and the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement after the initiation of ribavirin therapy.",0.4640387068702425
"A 79-year-old male farmer from China presented with high-grade fever, progressive dyspnea, and cough three days after a known tick bite. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed profound thrombocytopenia (25×10^9/L) and leukopenia (1.24×10^9/L). His condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to progressive multiorgan failure with severe metabolic acidosis, acute liver and kidney injury, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Neurological involvement was prominent, with altered mental status, nuchal rigidity, and a declining Glasgow Coma Scale score. Despite aggressive critical care, the patient's condition progressed to refractory viral sepsis and he ultimately died.",[],"Diagnosis: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
Reason: The patient presented with high-grade fever, progressive dyspnea, and cough, which are characteristic symptoms of SARS. Additionally, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to progressive multiorgan failure with severe metabolic acidosis, acute liver and kidney injury, and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which are also characteristic of SARS.","The diagnosis is Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne phlebovirus. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's history of a tick bite in an endemic region (China) followed by the classic triad of high fever, severe thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The clinical course was marked by rapid progression to multiorgan failure, encephalopathy, and death. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the detection of SFTSV-RNA via multiplex PCR analysis performed by the local disease control center.",0.20772850349740302
"A 57-year-old immunocompromised female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate presented with a 24-hour history of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. She also reported a cough and headache. On examination, she was found to have multiple skin lesions in various stages of evolution, including pustules, papules, and vesicles, distributed across her body. The patient had a history of travel to a coastal area one month prior. Laboratory tests showed an elevated C-reactive protein, and a chest CT scan revealed multiple diffuse solid nodules in both lungs with ground-glass opacities.

Reason: The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, are consistent with SLE, which is characterized by skin lesions, including pustules, papules, and vesicles. The elevated C-reactive protein and the presence of multiple diffuse solid nodules in both lungs with ground-glass opacities are also consistent with SLE.","The final diagnosis is Monkeypox (Mpox). This is supported by the patient's presentation with a characteristic diffuse skin rash (pustules, papules, vesicles) in the context of being immunocompromised and having a recent travel history. Although she presented with atypical symptoms like abdominal pain and had pulmonary nodules on CT, the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting viral DNA via a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.",0.211081657991752
"A 27-year-old Ugandan woman with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV presented with a two-month history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. She had a remote history of lower back pain treated as lumbago two years prior, but denied recent constitutional symptoms like cough or weight loss. Examination revealed a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine. An initial ultrasound suggested a psoas abscess. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh.

Reason: The CT scan shows extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass, which are characteristic of HIV-related bone disease.","The diagnosis is Pott disease, or spinal tuberculosis. This is supported by the patient's risk factors (HIV infection, living in an endemic area) and the clinical findings of a spinal deformity (gibbus) and a large abscess. The CT scan findings of lytic vertebral destruction and a paravertebral cold abscess are classic for this condition. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by identifying acid-fast bacilli on a Ziehl-Neelsen stain and detecting rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis via GeneXpert on a sample from the drained abscess.",0.46969553842750517
"A 10-year-old Tibetan girl presented with a two-month history of moderate to severe headache and nonprojectile vomiting. She had no fever or initial seizures. An important epidemiological clue was that six of her schoolmates presented with similar symptoms and were suspected of having cysticercosis. Laboratory tests showed a mild peripheral eosinophilia and slightly elevated protein and white blood cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. A brain MRI was performed and showed numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum. Some of these lesions had a characteristic ""hole-with-dot"" appearance, and serum ELISA was positive for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.

Reason: The presence of numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum, along with a characteristic ""hole-with-dot"" appearance, and a positive serum ELISA for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.","The diagnosis is massive neurocysticercosis, caused by infection of the central nervous system with the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This is supported by the chronic headache in a child from an endemic region with a cluster of similar cases among her schoolmates. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuroimaging and serology. The brain MRI showed numerous cystic lesions with the pathognomonic ""hole-with-dot"" sign (representing the scolex within the cyst), and serum ELISA for anticysticercal IgG antibodies was positive. The patient's good response to antiparasitic treatment with albendazole and praziquantel further supported the diagnosis.",0.6304653053415998
"A 49-year-old man was hospitalized for fever, rigors, and diarrhea. His medical history is significant for a trip to Peru eight weeks prior. Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210. Liver function tests were also abnormal, and a blood culture was positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Tests for malaria, dengue, and other common travel-related infections were negative.",[],"Diagnosis: Salmonella enteritidis infection
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including fever, rigors, and diarrhea, are consistent with Salmonella enteritidis infection. The laboratory tests, including anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and high C-reactive protein level, are also indicative of this infection.","The diagnosis is the chronic phase of Oroya fever, known as verruga peruana, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis. This is supported by the patient's travel history to Peru, an endemic region, and the classic biphasic presentation. He initially had an acute febrile illness with anemia (acute Oroya fever), followed by the development of characteristic red vascular skin nodules (verruga peruana). The concurrent Salmonella enteritidis bacteremia is a well-known complication of the immunosuppression associated with acute Oroya fever. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Bartonella bacilliformis.",0.2073632358300292
"A 30-year-old male presented with fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain after returning from Cyprus. He was referred to a hospital for investigation of a pyrexia of unknown origin. On examination, hepato-splenomegaly was noted. A temperature chart recorded by the patient showed an undulant pattern over several weeks. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, with slightly elevated transaminases. A chest X-ray was normal and a T-spot test for tuberculosis was negative.",[],"Diagnosis: Pyrexia of unknown origin
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain, along with the presence of anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and slightly elevated transaminases, are consistent with a pyrexia of unknown origin. The chest X-ray and T-spot test for tuberculosis were normal, which further supports this diagnosis.","The diagnosis is brucellosis, caused by a bacterium of the genus *Brucella*. The clinical picture of a pyrexia of unknown origin with night sweats, arthralgia, and hepato-splenomegaly in a traveler returning from an endemic region is highly suggestive. The characteristic undulant fever pattern and laboratory findings of pancytopenia further support the diagnosis. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the isolation of *Brucella* from a blood culture.",0.6254858279103734
"A 38-year-old man presented with a one-week history of high-grade intermittent fever, rigors, chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia. For the past two days, he has also experienced reddish-colored urine with clots and two episodes of gum bleeding. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, but he had multiple purpura and petechiae on his shoulder, trunk, and legs, as well as large ecchymotic lesions on his back. Laboratory studies revealed a very low platelet count of 20,000/μL and a low white blood cell count of 2.4 x 10^9/L. A tourniquet test was also positive.
