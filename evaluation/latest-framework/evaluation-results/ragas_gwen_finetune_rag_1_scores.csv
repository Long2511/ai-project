"A 49-year-old man was hospitalized for fever, rigors, and diarrhea. His medical history is significant for a trip to Peru eight weeks prior. Shortly after returning, he experienced a week-long febrile illness with myalgia, which resolved. However, his symptoms of fever and rigors recurred, and he developed multiple red vascular cutaneous nodules on his trunk and legs. On admission, laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 8.3 g/dl), an elevated white blood cell count, and a high C-reactive protein level of 210. Liver function tests were also abnormal, and a blood culture was positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Tests for malaria, dengue, and other common travel-related infections were negative.","['[{""case_id"": ""20---A-43-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-M_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr"", ""rerank_score"": 0.6353209018707275, ""disease"": ""Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome)""}, {""case_id"": ""85---A-55-Year-Old-Female-Pig-Farmer-from-Vietnam-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Tr"", ""rerank_score"": 0.34420067071914673, ""disease"": ""Streptococcus suis meningitis""}, {""case_id"": ""87---A-27-Year-Old-Male-Traveller-Returning-from-the_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-"", ""rerank_score"": 0.25494658946990967, ""disease"": ""Mayaro fever""}, {""case_id"": ""52---A-56-Year-Old-Man-from-Peru-With-Prolonged-_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop"", ""rerank_score"": 0.21216240525245667, ""disease"": ""Bartonellosis""}, {""case_id"": ""93---A-35-Year-Old-Male-Logger-from-Peru-With-Fe_2022_Clinical-Cases-in-Trop"", ""rerank_score"": 0.19123832881450653, ""disease"": ""Yellow fever""}]']",Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome),"The diagnosis is the chronic phase of Oroya fever, known as verruga peruana, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis.

"A 30-year-old male presented with fever, night sweats, backache, and hip pain after returning from Cyprus. He was referred to a hospital for investigation of a pyrexia of unknown origin. On examination, hepato-splenomegaly was noted. A temperature chart recorded by the patient showed an undulant pattern over several weeks.

"A 38-year-old man presented with a one-week history of high-grade intermittent fever, rigors, chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia. For the past two days, he has also experienced reddish-colored urine with clots and two episodes of gum bleeding. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, but he had multiple purpura and petechiae on his shoulder, trunk, and legs, as well as large ecchymotic lesions on his back. Laboratory studies revealed a very low platelet count of 20,000/μL and a low white blood cell count of 2.4 x 10^9/L. A tourniquet test was also positive.
