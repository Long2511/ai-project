The patient reports an acute self-limiting febrile illness accompanied by a rash before the onset of the polyarthralgias, which had clinically been diagnosed as dengue infection at a local hospital in Peru.\n\nTwo main differential diagnoses should be considered in patients presenting with persisting or prolonged arthritis/arthralgias and a history of a preceding infection:\n\nReactive arthritis is a rheumatoid factor (RF)-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often preceded by an infection. The most common triggers are gastrointestinal infections (caused by Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis). Reactive arthritis may manifest as monoarthritis (often affecting the knee or sacroiliac joint) or as oligoarthritis (usually of the lower extremities). The course may be additive (i.e. more joints becoming inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or migratory (new joints becoming inflamed after the initially inflamed joint has already improved). It usually develops within 2 to 4 weeks of the preceding infection. Reactive arthritis may also manifest with the classical triad of symptoms termed “Reiter's syndrome”: (i) inflammatory arthritis of large joints, (ii) inflammation of the eyes manifesting as conjunctivitis or uveitis and (iii) urethritis in men or cervicitis in women\n\nUpon return home to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient consulted his general practitioner because of persisting, incapacitating polyarthralgias. The patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility. Physical examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (swelling, redness, effusion). Laboratory tests were performed including serological testing for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi but none revealed a cause for the symptoms. For two more months, the joint pains did not improve; thus the patient was referred to a rheumatologist and subsequently to a tropical medicine clinic for evaluation of a putative travel-related cause of his polyarthralgias.""]","Diagnosis: Disseminated Histoplasmosis
Reason: The patient's severe immunosuppression from rheumatoid arthritis medications, residence in an endemic area (Ohio), and clinical findings of acute respiratory failure with yeast in bronchoalveolar lavage and a positive urine antigen test are classic for this fungal infection.","The diagnosis is histoplasmosis, caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.

"A 25-year-old male was hospitalized for vomiting blood. On examination, he was found to have an enlarged liver and spleen, and endoscopy confirmed the presence of esophageal varices. Blood tests revealed anemia and a significantly elevated eosinophil count. Serological tests for hepatitis B and C were negative, and the patient denied excessive alcohol use. A liver biopsy showed extensive granulomatous changes and fibrosis. Further history revealed he spent his childhood in Kenya where he frequently swam in a lake.

The patient was prescribed doxycycline at 100 mg bid PO for 1 week. The fever settled within the next few days and the lymphadenopathy subsided. The eschar eventually healed after about 2 weeks.\n\nDiagnosis of ATBF is usually made clinically, but in febrile individuals living in or returning from tropical areas malaria should still be ruled out.\n\nPCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is a non-invasive and sensitive way to confirm the diagnosis of acute infection. Serodiagnosis remains the gold standard for spotted-fever group rickettsial infections using seroconversion and fourfold antibody titre increases. Its use in clinical decision-making is however limited because of poor sensitivity during acute infection (antibodies are often not detectable within the first 10-14 days), the indirect nature of diagnostic evidence and cross-reaction with other Rickettsiae. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is currently considered the gold standard serological test.\n\nTreatment may not be necessary in mild cases. Doxycycline 100 mg bid PO may be given for 3 to 7 days. In pregnant women and in children younger than 8 years of age, macrolides are an alternative.\n\nThe incubation period following the bite of an infected tick is about 6 to 10 days. Patients develop fever and flu-like symptoms such as myalgias and headache. There may be a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. It may however take some time for the pathognomonic eschar to demarcate and early lesions may be non-specific erythematous papules, resembling mosquito bites. Multiple inoculation eschars are not uncommon, because Amblyomma ticks are known to aggressively attack their hosts.\n\nDespite the fact that African tick-bite fever belongs to the group of 'spotted fevers', a rash is seen in less than half of cases. ATBF is usually a mild illness and no deaths have been reported so far.\n\nHowever, neurological involvement has been described in ATBF, including encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Also, retinitis and panuveitis have been described.\n\nA 52-year-old German man presents with a short history of fever after a trip to South Africa. On examination there is a small necrotic skin lesion on his upper thigh with adjoining lymphangiitis and lymphadenitis.\n\nThe skin lesion is a typical eschar. Given the travel history, the clinical diagnosis is most likely African tick-bite fever. This rickettsial disease is a common cause of fever in safari tourists returning from Southern Africa.\n\nThe patient has travelled to KwaZulu-Natal, which is a malaria-endemic region, and he has not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In any febrile traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region, malaria has to be ruled out, even if other diagnoses seem obvious.\n\nThe diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is primarily clinical.""]","Diagnosis: African tick-bite fever
Reason: The patient's presentation of a necrotic eschar at a tick bite site, regional lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms (malaise, headache, myalgia) after returning from Kenya is the classic triad for this rickettsial infection.","The diagnosis is African Tick Bite Fever, a form of rickettsiosis. This is strongly suggested by the patient's travel history to Kenya and the clinical presentation of a painful black eschar (tache noire) at the site of a tick bite. The associated symptoms of headache, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy are also characteristic of this infection, which is caused by the bacterium *Rickettsia africae*.

"A 19-year-old woman presented for a routine gynecologic examination with a complaint of mid-cycle bleeding. She is sexually active with one partner and is taking oral contraceptives. On internal examination, a mucopurulent discharge was noted at the external cervical os. The cervix was also observed to be friable and bled easily on contact. An endocervical swab was collected for testing due to suspicion of a sexually transmitted infection, and the test result was positive.

Specialized viral HF precautions and personal protective equipment are warranted when there is a confirmed case or high index of suspicion, such as in this case.\n\nIntravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and analgesics were begun on admission. Nevertheless, the patient's condition rapidly worsened, with subconjunctival haemorrhage, copious bleeding from the mouth, nose and rectum (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2), dyspnoea and hypothermic shock (temperature 36.0°C, blood pressure unreadable, pulse 150 bpm, respiratory rate 36 cycles per minute). She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission. Laboratory testing at a specialized laboratory established as part of the outbreak response showed positive ELISA antigen and PCR tests for Ebola virus and a negative result for ELISA IgG antibody, confirming the diagnosis of Ebola virus disease.\n\nTreatment is supportive. Antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed. Preliminary results from a clinical trial of experimental compounds conducted during an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo show very promising results, reducing case fatality to as low as 10% if treatment is administered early in the course of disease. Similarly, a clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and during the massive 2013 to 2016 outbreak in West Africa showed protective efficacy of over 90%.\n\nThis patient was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in northern Uganda, so the diagnosis was strongly suspected. She was admitted to the isolation ward that had been established as part of the international outbreak response. No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syndromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease.

After additional bleeding complications at inguinal and thoracic insertion sites, she underwent several surgical interventions. Nosocomial infections followed, and she remained in intensive care for 5 months and an additional 12 months in rehabilitation. The mode of transmission remained unclear; both human-to-human-transmission and acquisition from a common source were possible.\n\nGiven the bleeding tendency seen in the wife, most viral haemorrhagic fevers can be excluded based on the incubation time alone, which is well below 21 days for most endemic viral haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, dengue and the New World arenaviruses, e.g. Junín virus and Machupo virus). There is only one exception to this rule, which is hantavirus infections: their incubation time may be up to 35 days.\n\nBoth patients should be referred to a tertiary care setting, which is equipped to handle ARDS and haemorrhagic fevers. Clinically, securing cardiorespiratory function is the main priority. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated as empirical treatment until further results are back.\n\nAlthough the aetiology is still unclear, a patient with respiratory symptoms must be treated under standard hygiene and droplet precautions (at least) to prevent potential nosocomial transmission. Depending on local hospital hygiene requirements, airborne precautions may be required.\n\nThe patient was found to have a Plasmodium falciparum parasite count of 18% and a plasma creatinine of 430 µmol/L (reference range 45–90 µmol/L), demonstrating acute kidney injury. Urine output failed to respond to fluid challenges, therefore pre-renal failure could be ruled out. She was treated with intravenous artesunate and the parasite count dropped to 5% but she lapsed into deep coma. Renal function deteriorated and she needed haemofiltration. After the parasites had cleared on day 5, her consciousness level began to improve, but she developed laboured breathing. The chest radiography findings were suggestive of ARDS, and she required prolonged respiratory support. She eventually made a full recovery.']","Diagnosis: Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia

"A 27-year-old Ugandan woman with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV presented with a two-month history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and low-grade fevers. She had a remote history of lower back pain treated as lumbago two years prior, but denied recent constitutional symptoms like cough or weight loss. Examination revealed a palpable, tender mass in the right iliac fossa and a gibbus deformity with tenderness over the lumbar spine. An initial ultrasound suggested a psoas abscess. A subsequent abdominal CT scan showed extensive lytic destruction of the L1-L4 vertebral bodies and a large, rim-enhancing paravertebral cystic mass extending from the lumbar spine into the retroperitoneal space and right thigh.

"A 10-year-old Tibetan girl presented with a two-month history of moderate to severe headache and nonprojectile vomiting. She had no fever or initial seizures. An important epidemiological clue was that six of her schoolmates presented with similar symptoms and were suspected of having cysticercosis. Laboratory tests showed a mild peripheral eosinophilia and slightly elevated protein and white blood cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. A brain MRI was performed and showed numerous cystic lesions throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum. Some of these lesions had a characteristic ""hole-with-dot"" appearance, and serum ELISA was positive for IgG antibodies against cysticerci.

Four years previously she went on an extensive backpacking trip around the world, visiting various places in South America and Asia. She lives on a vegan diet. Her physical examination including her neurological status are completely normal. The basic blood and CSF results are normal and do not reveal any signs of inflammation. The MRI of the brain shows multiple cystic lesions in both hemispheres.\n\nThe patient presents with a focal epileptic seizure. Her paraesthesias represent a so-called Jacksonian 'sensory march'. Neuroimaging reveals multiple cortical and subcortical lesions. The cortical lesions in the left hemisphere are likely to be responsible for the patient's epileptic disorder on the contralateral side of her body.\n\nParasitic infection of the meninges typically results in eosin-ophilic meningitis. The next investigation to perform is a lumbar puncture to confirm meningitis and to look for a pos-sibly eosinophilic profile of inflammation. Eosinophilic meningitis in an otherwise healthy person with positive his-tory of exposure to helminths and features of an outbreak is almost always attributable to a parasitic infestation.\nThe main differential diagnoses are fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis (in North and Central America), lymphoma, eosinophilic leukaemia, sarcoid and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.\nIt is important to measure the CSF opening pressure.
